# Node Identity and Configuration

When installing a node on an Aptos network, the installation steps require you to work with identities and configurations. This document describes how to interpret the terms **identity** and **configuration**, and presents a description of the identity YAML files.

## Concept

This section presents a mental-model view of an identity and configuration. It is meant to help make the node installation process easy.

The terms **identity** and **configuration** should be understood in the following way:

- The terms **validator node**, **fullnode**, and **validator fullnode** refer to the machine (physical or virtual).
- The terms **operator**, **owner** and **voter** refer to the persona.
- A machine has both an identity and a configuration. They are defined in separate YAML files. A persona's identity and configuration are combined into a single YAML file.

### Machine

#### Identity

Machine **identity** is defined in a YAML file. An identity is established by means of keys. A machine identity YAML contains only private keys. Moreover, an identity YAML always contains the associated blockchain account address.

A machine identity YAML has the string `identity` in its name. For example:

- validator-**identity**.yaml contains the private keys for the validator node.
- validator-full-node-**identity**.yaml contains the private keys for validator fullnode and public fullnode.

Hence, if you are looking for your machine’s private keys, look for YAML filenames with `identity` in them.

#### Configuration

Machine **configuration** is also defined in a YAML file. A machine configuration YAML **never contains any key, public or private**. For example, the configuration YAML files validator.yaml, fullnode.yaml, docker-compose.yaml and docker-compose-fullnode.yaml **do not contain any keys.**

As noted earlier, a machine has an identity and a configuration. Hence:

- For a validator node, identity is defined in validator-**identity**.yaml and configuration is in validator.yaml.
- For a validator fullnode, its identity is defined in validator-full-node-**identity**.yaml and its configuration is defined in fullnode.yaml.

### Persona

#### Identity and configuration

A persona has a single YAML that combines the persona’s identity and configuration information. For example, for the three personas, owner, operator and voter:

- An owner's identity-configuration is defined in **owner.yaml**. The owner.yaml contains the public keys and blockchain account addresses for owner, operator and voter, and some owner-specific configuration such as stake amount and commission percentage.
- An operator’s identity-configuration is defined in **operator.yaml**. The operator.yaml contains public keys and blockchain account address for the operator and some machine configuration information plus a consensus public key and consensus proof of possession key. **Only the operator has the consensus keys.** Neither the owner nor the voter has the consensus keys.
- A voter's identity-configuration, i.e., voter.yaml, does not exist.

## Description of identity YAML files

This section explains the following key and identity YAML files that are generated during the deployment of a validator node:

- `public-keys.yaml`.
- `private-keys.yaml`.
- `validator-identity.yaml`.
- `validator-full-node-identity.yaml`.

The following command is used to generate the above key and identity YAML files. See, for example, [Step 10 while using AWS to deploy the validator node](./validator-node/operator/running-validator-node/using-aws.md), or in [Step 10 while using GCP](./validator-node/operator/running-validator-node/using-gcp.md).

```bash
aptos genesis generate-keys --output-dir ~/$WORKSPACE/keys
```

See below a diagram that shows how the identities for the validator node and validator fullnode are derived from the private and public keys:
