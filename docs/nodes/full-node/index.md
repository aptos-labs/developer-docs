# Run a Public Fullnode

This section explains how to deploy a public fullnode (PFN) to connect to the Aptos networks. You can learn more about
the different types of nodes in the [Blockchain Deep Dive](../../concepts/blockchain.md) section.

:::tip Default connection to mainnet
If you follow the default setup in this document, then your PFN will be connected to the Aptos mainnet. To connect
to a different Aptos network, such as devnet or testnet, make sure you have the correct docker image tag, or source
code branch if you build the binary directly.

You can find the genesis and waypoint files for all the networks, here âžœ https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-networks.
