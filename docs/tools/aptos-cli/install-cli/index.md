# Install the Aptos CLI

You can install the Aptos CLI as a pre-compiled binary:

- [Install the Aptos CLI with Homebrew](./install-from-brew.md) - Recommended for macOS.
- [Install the Aptos CLI by script](./automated-install.md) - Recommended for Linux and Windows.
- [Download the prebuilt Aptos CLI binaries](./download-cli-binaries.md) - Generally not recommended, but useful if you prefer not to use an automated installation method.

You can also [build the Aptos CLI from source code](./build-from-source.md). This allows you to build from any of the Aptos branches, including `devnet`, `testnet`, `mainnet`, and the latest code in `main`, the development branch.

## (Optional) Installing the Move Prover

Optionally, you can [install the Move Prover](./install-move-prover.md).
