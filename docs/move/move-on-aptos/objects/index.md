# What are objects?

The Object model allows Move to represent a set of resources stored at an
address with resource control and ownership management.

It's simply represented as an `ObjectCore` struct, which keeps track of the
owner of the `Object` and transfer permissions. Along with the ability to store
resources with an `ObjectGroup`. You can find more technical details at the
[Object standard](/standards/aptos-object.md) page, and view the code at the
[framework generated object documentation](/reference/move/##?branch=mainnet&page=aptos-framework/doc/object.md).
