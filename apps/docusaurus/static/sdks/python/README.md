# Aptos Python SDK

[![Discord][discord-image]][discord-url]

This provides basic functionalities to interact with [Aptos](https:/github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/). Get started [here](https://aptos.dev/guides/system-integrators-guide/#getting-started).

Currently this is still in development and may not be suitable for production purposes.

Note: The sync client is deprecated, please only start new projects using the async client. Feature contributions to the sync client will be rejected.

## Requirements

This SDK uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for packaging and dependency management:

```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
poetry install
```

## Unit testing

```bash
make test
```

## E2E testing and Using the Aptos CLI

- Download the [Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/tools/aptos-cli/install-cli/).
- Set the environment variable `APTOS_CLI_PATH` to the full path of the CLI.
- `make examples_cli`

We of course allow you to do this a bit more manually by:

First, run a local testnet (run this from the root of aptos-core):

```bash
cargo run -p aptos -- node run-local-testnet --force-restart --assume-yes
```

Next, tell the end-to-end tests to talk to this locally running testnet:

```bash
export APTOS_NODE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1"
export APTOS_FAUCET_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8081"
```

Finally run the tests:

```bash
make examples
```

Note: These end-to-end tests are tested against a node built from the same commit as part of CI, not devnet. For examples tested against devnet, see `static/examples/python/` from the root of the repo.

## Autoformatting

```bash
make fmt
```

## Package Publishing

- Download the [Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/tools/aptos-cli/install-cli/).
- Set the environment variable `APTOS_CLI_PATH` to the full path of the CLI.
- `poetry run python -m aptos_sdk.cli` and set the appropriate command-line parameters

## Generating types

The Python `openapi-python-client` tool cannot parse references. Therefore there are three options:

- Use swagger-cli to dereference, gain a type explosion, and still have missing types
- Live without missing types
- Write a pure python implementation with no autogenerated code

Currently the team is moving forward with pure python, but leaves the following notes for the curious:

```bash
npm install  -g @apidevtools/swagger-cli
swagger-cli bundle --dereference ../../../api/doc/v0/openapi.yaml  -t yaml > openapi.yaml
python3 -m openapi_python_client generate --path openapi.yaml
mv aptos-dev-api-specification-client/aptos_dev_api_specification_client/ aptos_sdk/openapi
```
