    A managed wrapper around sequence numbers that implements the trivial flow control used by the
    Aptos faucet:
    * Submit up to 100 transactions per account in parallel with a timeout of 20 seconds
    * If local assumes 100 are in flight, determine the actual committed state from the network
    * If there are less than 100 due to some being committed, adjust the window
    * If 100 are in flight Wait .1 seconds before re-evaluating
    * If ever waiting more than 30 seconds restart the sequence number to the current on-chain state
    Assumptions:
    * Accounts are expected to be managed by a single AccountSequenceNumber and not used otherwise.
    * They are initialized to the current on-chain state, so if there are already transactions in
      flight, they may take some time to reset.
    * Accounts are automatically initialized if not explicitly

    Notes:
    * This is co-routine safe, that is many async tasks can be reading from this concurrently.
    * The state of an account cannot be used across multiple AccountSequenceNumber services.
    * The synchronize method will create a barrier that prevents additional next_sequence_number
      calls until it is complete.
    * This only manages the distribution of sequence numbers it does not help handle transaction
      failures.
    * If a transaction fails, you should call synchronize and wait for timeouts.
    * Mempool limits the number of transactions per account to 100, hence why we chose 100.
