# Use the Aptos Fullnode REST API

If you wish to employ the [Aptos API](https://aptos.dev/nodes/aptos-api-spec/#/), then this guide is for you. This guide will walk you through all you need to integrate the Aptos blockchain into your platform with the Aptos API.

Also see the [System Integrators Guide](../guides/system-integrators-guide.md) for a thorough walkthrough of Aptos integration.

## Understanding rate limits

As with the [Aptos Indexer](../indexer/api/labs-hosted.md#rate-limits), the Aptos REST API has a rate limit of 5000 requests per five minutes by IP address, whether submitting transactions or querying the API on Aptos-provided nodes. (As a node operator, you may raise those limits on your own node.) Note that this limit can change with or without prior notice.

## Viewing current and historical state

Most integrations into the Aptos blockchain benefit from a holistic and comprehensive overview of the current and historical state of the blockchain. Aptos provides historical transactions, state, and events, all the result of transaction execution.

- Historical transactions specify the execution status, output, and tie to related events. Each transaction has a unique version number associated with it that dictates its global sequential ordering in the history of the blockchain ledger.
- The state is the representation of all transaction outputs up to a specific version. In other words, a state version is the accumulation of all transactions inclusive of that transaction version.
- As transactions execute, they may emit events. [Events](../concepts/events.md) are hints about changes in on-chain data.

:::important
Ensure the [fullnode](../nodes/networks.md) you are communicating with is up-to-date. The fullnode must reach the version containing your transaction to retrieve relevant data from it. There can be latency from the fullnodes retrieving state from [validator fullnodes](../concepts/fullnodes.md), which in turn rely upon [validator nodes](../concepts/validator-nodes.md) as the source of truth.
:::

The storage service on a node employs two forms of pruning that erase data from nodes:

- state
- events, transactions, and everything else

While either of these may be disabled, storing the state versions is not particularly sustainable.

Events and transactions pruning can be disabled via setting the [`enable_ledger_pruner`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/cf0bc2e4031a843cdc0c04e70b3f7cd92666afcf/config/src/config/storage_config.rs#L141) to `false` in `storage_config.rs`. This is default behavior in Mainnet. In the near future, Aptos will provide indexers that mitigate the need to directly query from a node.

The REST API offers querying transactions and events in these ways:

- [Transactions for an account](https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/operations/get_account_transactions)
- [Transactions by version](https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/operations/get_transaction_by_version)
- [Events by event handle](https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/operations/get_events_by_event_handle)

## Reading state with the View function

View functions do not modify blockchain state when called from the API. A [View](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/api/src/view_function.rs) function and its [input](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/api/types/src/view.rs) can be used to read potentially complex on-chain state using Move. For example, you can evaluate who has the highest bid in an auction contract. Here are related files:

- [`view_function.rs`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/api/src/tests/view_function.rs) for an example
- related [Move](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/90c33dc7a18662839cd50f3b70baece0e2dbfc71/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/coin.move#L226) code
- [specification](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/90c33dc7a18662839cd50f3b70baece0e2dbfc71/api/doc/spec.yaml#L8513).

The view function operates like the [Aptos Simulation API](../guides/system-integrators-guide.md#testing-transactions-or-transaction-pre-execution), though with no side effects and an accessible output path. View functions can be called via the `/view` endpoint. Calls to view functions require the module and function names along with input type parameters and values.

A function does not have to be immutable to be tagged as `#[view]`, but if the function is mutable it will not result in state mutation when called from the API.
If you want to tag a mutable function as `#[view]`, consider making it private so that it cannot be maliciously called during runtime.

In order to use the View functions, you need to [publish the module](../tools/aptos-cli/use-cli/working-with-move-contracts.md#4-publishing-move-contracts) through the [Aptos CLI](../tools/aptos-cli/install-cli/index.md).

In the Aptos CLI, a view function request would look like this:

```
aptos move view --function-id devnet::message::get_message --profile devnet --args address:devnet
{
  "Result": [
    "View functions rock!"
  ]
}
```

In the TypeScript SDK, a view function request would look like this:

```
    const payload: Gen.ViewRequest = {
      function: "0x1::coin::balance",
      type_arguments: ["0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin"],
      arguments: [alice.address().hex()],
    };

    const balance = await client.view(payload);

    expect(balance[0]).toBe("100000000");
```

The view function returns a list of values as a vector. By default, the results are returned in JSON format; however, they can be optionally returned in Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS) encoded format.
