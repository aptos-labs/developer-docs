# Install the Aptos CLI on Mac

For Mac, the easiest way to install the Aptos CLI is with the package manager `brew`.

# Installation

1. Ensure you have `brew` installed https://brew.sh/.
2. Open a new terminal and enter the following commands.

```bash
    brew update
    brew install aptos
```

3. Open another terminal and run `aptos help` to verify the CLI is installed.

```bash
   aptos help
```

:::tip
If `brew` does not work for you, you can also use the steps here: [Install Specific Aptos CLI Versions (Advanced)](install-cli-specific-version.md)

# Upgrading the CLI

Upgrading the CLI with brew just takes 2 commands:

```bash
  brew update
  brew upgrade aptos
```
