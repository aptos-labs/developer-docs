# Use the Aptos CLI with Ledger

The `aptos` tool can be used with your Ledger device to sign any transaction. This is the most secure way to sign transactions, as your private key never leaves your device.

NOTE: It is highly recommended to use `Ledger Nano S Plus` or `Ledger Nano X` devices. The `Ledger Nano S` device has very limited memory and may not be able to sign most of the transactions. If you are trying to sign a transaction that is too big for your device to handle, you will get an error `Wrong raw transaction length`.

## Blind Signing

Before you begin, make sure you have `Blind Signing` enabled on your Ledger device. Otherwise, you will not be able to sign transactions.
`Blind Signing` - confirming a smart contract interaction you can’t verify through a human-readable language.

## Create a new Ledger profile

In order to interact with your Ledger device, you must first create a new profile. This profile will be used to store your Ledger public key, and will be used to sign transactions.

```bash
$ aptos init --profile myprofile --ledger
Configuring for profile myprofile
Choose network from [devnet, testnet, mainnet, local, custom | defaults to devnet]

No network given, using devnet...
Please choose an index from the following 5 ledger accounts, or choose an arbitrary index that you want to use:
[0] Derivation path: m/44'/637'/0'/0'/0' (Address: 59836ba1dd0c845713bdab34346688d6f1dba290dbf677929f2fc20593ba0cfb)

Aptos CLI is now set up for account 59836ba1dd0c845713bdab34346688d6f1dba290dbf677929f2fc20593ba0cfb as profile myprofile!  Run `aptos --help` for more information about commands
{
  "Result": "Success"
}
```

In the above, we have created a new profile called `myprofile` and have chosen to use the first Ledger account (index 0) to sign transactions. If there is a certain index account you would like to use, you are welcome to use it.

After the above command, a new profile will be created in `~/.aptos/config.yml` and will look like the following:

```yaml
myprofile:
  public_key: "0x05a8ace09d1136181029be3e817de3619562b0da2eedbff210e2b2f92c71be70"
  account: 59836ba1dd0c845713bdab34346688d6f1dba290dbf677929f2fc20593ba0cfb
  rest_url: "https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com"
  faucet_url: "https://faucet.devnet.aptoslabs.com"
  derivation_path: "m/44'/637'/0'/0'/0'"
```

Notice that the above stores the derivation path instead of private key. This is because the private key is stored on your Ledger device, and is never exposed to the `aptos` tool.

## Publish a package with Ledger

Once you have created a profile, you can use it to publish a package. The `aptos` tool will prompt you to confirm the transaction on your Ledger device.
Note: Make sure that you are on the same directory as where your move module is located:

```bash
$ aptos move publish --profile myprofile --named-addresses hello_blockchain=myprofile

    "version": 126445,
    "vm_status": "Executed successfully"
  }
}
```

After the above command, you will be prompted to confirm the transaction on your Ledger device. Once you confirm, the transaction will be submitted to the network. Note: Make sure you have `Blind Signing` enabled on your Ledger device. Otherwise, you will not be able to sign transactions.
`Blind Signing` - confirming a smart contract interaction you can’t verify through a human-readable language.

## Common Errors

### Error: Wrong raw transaction length

Your raw transaction or package size is too big. Currently, the Aptos ledger app can only support up to 20kb transaction. If you are using a `Ledger Nano S`, the supported transaction size will be even smaller.

```bash
{
  "Error": "Unexpected error: Error - Wrong raw transaction length"
}
```

### Error: Ledger device is locked

Make sure your Ledger device is unlocked and you have Aptos app opened

```bash
{
  "Error": "Unexpected error: Error - Ledger device is locked"
}
```
