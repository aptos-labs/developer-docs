# Use the Aptos CLI

The `aptos` tool is a command line interface (CLI) for developing on the Aptos blockchain, debugging, and for node operations. This document describes how to use the `aptos` CLI tool. To download or build the CLI, follow [Install Aptos CLI](../install-cli/index.md).

For example on how to use specific commands, see the following documents:

- [Configuration and Initialization](./cli-configuration.md)
- [Account](./cli-account.md)
- [Key](./cli-key.md)
- [Node](./cli-node.md)
- [Move](../../../move/move-on-aptos/cli.md)
- [Genesis](./cli-genesis.md)

### Sub-command help

Help for sub-commands is also available. For example, see below the usage output from `aptos move compile --help`:

```bash

Usage: aptos move compile [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --save-metadata
          Save the package metadata in the package's build directory

          If set, package metadata should be generated and stored in the package's build directory. This metadata can be used to construct a transaction to publish a package.

      --included-artifacts <INCLUDED_ARTIFACTS>
          Artifacts to be generated when building the package

          Which artifacts to include in the package. This can be one of `none`, `sparse`, and `all`. `none` is the most compact form and does not allow to reconstruct a source package from chain; `sparse` is the minimal set of artifacts needed to reconstruct a source package; `all` includes all available artifacts. The choice of included artifacts heavily influences the size and therefore gas cost of publishing: `none` is the size of bytecode alone; `sparse` is roughly 2 times as much; and `all` 3-4 as much.

          [default: sparse]
          [possible values: none, sparse, all]

      --dev
          Enables dev mode, which uses all dev-addresses and dev-dependencies

          Dev mode allows for changing dependencies and addresses to the preset [dev-addresses] and [dev-dependencies] fields.  This works both inside and out of tests for using preset values.

          Currently, it also additionally pulls in all test compilation artifacts

      --package-dir <PACKAGE_DIR>
          Path to a move package (the folder with a Move.toml file)

      --output-dir <OUTPUT_DIR>
          Path to save the compiled move package

          Defaults to `<package_dir>/build`

      --named-addresses <NAMED_ADDRESSES>
          Named addresses for the move binary

          Example: alice=0x1234, bob=0x5678

          Note: This will fail if there are duplicates in the Move.toml file remove those first.

          [default: ]

      --skip-fetch-latest-git-deps
          Skip pulling the latest git dependencies

          If you don't have a network connection, the compiler may fail due to no ability to pull git dependencies.  This will allow overriding this for local development.

      --bytecode-version <BYTECODE_VERSION>
          Specify the version of the bytecode the compiler is going to emit

      --compiler-version <COMPILER_VERSION>
          Specify the version of the compiler

          [possible values: v1, v2]

      --skip-attribute-checks
          Do not complain about unknown attributes in Move code

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```
