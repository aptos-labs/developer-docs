# Legacy Indexer

:::caution Deprecation Alert

From Now - end of Q2, 2024: We will not be adding any new features to the legacy Indexer. However, we will continue to generally support the community, and will make sure that any changes made on the blockchain level does not break the existing legacy processors.

After Q2, 2024: We will remove the indexer crates from the [aptos-core](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core) repo and the legacy indexer will no longer be supported. Please look at our new [Transaction Stream Service](/indexer/txn-stream/) and updated [Indexer API](/indexer/api/)
