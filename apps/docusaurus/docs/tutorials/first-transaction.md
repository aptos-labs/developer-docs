## Step 3: Understand the output

<Tabs groupId="sdk-examples">
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">
    An output very similar to the following will appear after executing the above command:

```yaml
=== Addresses ===

Alice's address is: 0xbd20517751571ba3fd06326c23761bc0bc69cf450898ffb43412fbe670c28806
Bob's address is: 0x8705f98a74f5efe17740276ed75031927402c3a965e10f2ee16cda46d99d8f7f

=== Initial Balances ===

Alice's balance is: 100000000
Bob's balance is: 0

=== Transfer 1000000 from Alice to Bob ===

Committed transaction: 0xc0d348afdfc34ae2c48971b253ece727cc9980dde182e2f2c42834552cbbf04c

=== Balances after transfer ===

Alice's balance is: 98899100
Bob's balance is: 1000000
```

The above output demonstrates that the `transfer-coin` example executes the following steps:

- Initializing the Aptos client.
- The creation of two accounts: Alice and Bob.
- The funding and creation of Alice's account from a faucet.
- The transferring of 1000000 coins from Alice to Bob.
- The 1100900 coins of gas paid for by Alice to make that transfer.

</TabItem>

  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    An output very similar to the following will appear after executing the above command:

```yaml

Alice: 0xbd20517751571ba3fd06326c23761bc0bc69cf450898ffb43412fbe670c28806
Bob: 0x8705f98a74f5efe17740276ed75031927402c3a965e10f2ee16cda46d99d8f7f

=== Initial Balances ===
Alice: 100000000
Bob: 0

=== Intermediate Balances ===
Alice: 99944900
Bob: 1000

=== Final Balances ===
Alice: 99889800
Bob: 2000
```

The above output demonstrates that the `transfer-coin` example executes the following steps:

- Initializing the REST and faucet clients.
- The creation of two accounts: Alice and Bob.
- The funding and creation of Alice's account from a faucet.
- The creation of Bob's account from a faucet.
- The transferring of 1000 coins from Alice to Bob.
- The 54100 coins of gas paid for by Alice to make that transfer.
- Another transfer of 1000 coins from Alice to Bob.
- The additional 54100 coins of gas paid for by Alice to make that transfer.

## Step 4: The SDK in depth

The `transfer-coin` example code uses helper functions to interact with the [REST API](https://aptos.dev/nodes/aptos-api-spec#/). This section reviews each of the calls and gives insights into functionality.

### Step 4.1: Initializing the clients

<Tabs groupId="sdk-examples">
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

In the first step, the `transfer_coin` example initializes the Aptos client:

```ts
const APTOS_NETWORK: Network =
  NetworkToNetworkName[process.env.APTOS_NETWORK] || Network.DEVNET;
const config = new AptosConfig({ network: APTOS_NETWORK });
const aptos = new Aptos(config);
```

:::tip
By default, the Aptos client points to Aptos devnet services. However, it can be configured with the `network` input argument
:::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
  In the first step, the `transfer-coin` example initializes both the REST and faucet clients:

- The REST client interacts with the REST API.
- The faucet client interacts with the devnet Faucet service for creating and funding accounts.

```python
:!: static/sdks/python/examples/transfer_coin.py section_1
```

[`common.py`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/main/ecosystem/python/sdk/examples/common.py) initializes these values as follows:

```python
:!: static/sdks/python/examples/common.py section_1
```

:::tip

By default, the URLs for both the services point to Aptos devnet services. However, they can be configured with the following environment variables:

- `APTOS_NODE_URL`
- `APTOS_FAUCET_URL`
  :::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">
  In the first step, the `transfer-coin` example initializes both the REST and faucet clients:

Using the API client we can create a `CoinClient`, which we use for common coin operations such as transferring coins and checking balances.

```rust
:!: static/sdks/rust/examples/transfer-coin.rs section_1b
```

In the example we initialize the URL values as such:

### Step 4.2: Creating local accounts

The next step is to create two accounts locally. [Accounts](../concepts/accounts.md) represent both on and off-chain state. Off-chain state consists of an address and the public/private key pair used to authenticate ownership. This step demonstrates how to generate that off-chain state.

<Tabs groupId="sdk-examples">
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

```ts
const alice = Account.generate();
const bob = Account.generate();
```

```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```rust
:!: static/sdks/rust/examples/transfer-coin.rs section_2
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

### Step 4.3: Creating blockchain accounts

In Aptos, each account must have an on-chain representation in order to receive tokens and coins and interact with other dapps. An account represents a medium for storing assets; hence, it must be explicitly created. This example leverages the Faucet to create and fund Alice's account and to create but not fund Bob's account:

<Tabs groupId="sdk-examples">
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

```ts
await aptos.fundAccount({
  accountAddress: alice.accountAddress,
  amount: 100_000_000,
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python

```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```rust
:!: static/sdks/rust/examples/transfer-coin.rs section_3
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

### Step 4.4: Reading balances

In this step, the SDK translates a single call into the process of querying a resource and reading a field from that resource.

<Tabs groupId="sdk-examples">
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

```ts
const aliceBalance = await balance("Alice", alice.accountAddress);
const bobBalance = await balance("Bob", bob.accountAddress);
```

Behind the scenes, the `balance` function uses the SDK `getAccountAPTAmount` function that queries the Indexer service and reads the current stored value:

```ts
const balance = async (
  name: string,
  accountAddress: AccountAddress,
): Promise<number> => {
  const amount = await aptos.getAccountAPTAmount({
    accountAddress,
  });
  console.log(`${name}'s balance is: ${amount}`);
  return amount;
};
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
:!: static/sdks/python/examples/transfer_coin.py section_4
```

Behind the scenes, the SDK queries the CoinStore resource for the AptosCoin and reads the current stored value:

```python
def account_balance(self, account_address: str) -> int:
    """Returns the test coin balance associated with the account"""
    return self.account_resource(
        account_address, "0x1::coin::CoinStore<0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin>"
    )["data"]["coin"]["value"]
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```rust
:!: static/sdks/rust/examples/transfer-coin.rs section_4
```

Behind the scenes, the SDK queries the CoinStore resource for the AptosCoin and reads the current stored value:

```rust
let balance = self
    .get_account_resource(address, "0x1::coin::CoinStore<0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin>")
    .await?;
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

### Step 4.5: Transferring

Like the previous step, this is another helper step that constructs a transaction transferring the coins from Alice to Bob. The SDK provides a helper function to generate a `transferCoinTransaction` transaction that can be simulated or submitted to chain. Once a transaction has been submitted to chain, the API will return a transaction hash that can be used in the subsequent step to check on the transaction status. The Aptos blockchain does perform a handful of validation checks on submission; and if any of those fail, the user will instead be given an error. These validations use the transaction signature and unused sequence number, and submitting the transaction to the appropriate chain.
<Tabs groupId="sdk-examples">
<TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

```ts
const transaction = await aptos.transferCoinTransaction({
  sender: alice,
  recipient: bob.accountAddress,
  amount: TRANSFER_AMOUNT,
});
const pendingTxn = await aptos.signAndSubmitTransaction({
  signer: alice,
  transaction,
});
```

Behind the scenes, the `transferCoinTransaction` function generates a transaction payload that can be simulated or submitted to chain:

```ts
export async function transferCoinTransaction(args: {
  aptosConfig: AptosConfig;
  sender: Account;
  recipient: AccountAddressInput;
  amount: AnyNumber;
  coinType?: MoveStructId;
  options?: InputGenerateTransactionOptions;
}): Promise<SingleSignerTransaction> {
  const { aptosConfig, sender, recipient, amount, coinType, options } = args;
  const coinStructType = coinType ?? APTOS_COIN;
  const transaction = await generateTransaction({
    aptosConfig,
    sender: sender.accountAddress,
    data: {
      function: "0x1::aptos_account::transfer_coins",
      typeArguments: [coinStructType],
      functionArguments: [recipient, amount],
    },
    options,
  });

  return transaction;
}
```

Breaking the above down into pieces:

1. `transfer_coins` internally is a `EntryFunction` in the [Aptos Account Move module](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/aptos_account.move#L92), i.e. an entry function in Move that is directly callable.
2. The Move function is stored on the aptos_account module: `0x1::aptos_account`.
3. The `transfer_coins` functions uses the [Coin Move module](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/coin.move)
4. Because the Coin module can be used by other coins, the `transferCoinTransaction` must explicitly specify which coin type to transfer. If not specified with `coinType` it defaults to `0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin`.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
Like the previous step, this is another helper step that constructs a transaction transferring the coins from Alice to Bob. For correctly generated transactions, the API will return a transaction hash that can be used in the subsequent step to check on the transaction status.

These validations use the transaction signature and unused sequence number, and submitting the transaction to the appropriate chain.

1. The Move function is stored on the coin module: `0x1::coin`.
1. Because the Coin module can be used by other coins, the transfer must explicitly use a `TypeTag` to define which coin to transfer.
1. The transaction arguments must be placed into `TransactionArgument`s with type specifiers (`Serializer.{type}`), that will serialize the value into the appropriate type at transaction generation time.

### Step 4.6: Waiting for transaction resolution

<Tabs groupId="sdk-examples">
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">

In the TypeScript SDK, just calling `waitForTransaction` is sufficient to wait for the transaction to complete. The function will return the `Transaction` returned by the API once it is processed (either successfully or unsuccessfully) or throw an error if processing time exceeds the timeout.

```ts
const response = await aptos.waitForTransaction({
  transactionHash: pendingTxn.hash,
});
```
