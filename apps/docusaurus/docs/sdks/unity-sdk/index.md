# Aptos Unity SDK

The [Aptos Unity SDK](https://github.com/aptos-labs/Aptos-Unity-SDK) is a .NET implementation of the [Aptos SDK](../index.md), compatible with .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 4.x for Unity. The goal of this SDK is to provide a set of tools for developers to build multi-platform applications (mobile, desktop, web, VR) using the Unity game engine and the Aptos blockchain infrastructure.

See the post [Aptos Labs brings Web3 to Gaming with its new SDK for Unity developers](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/aptos-labs-brings-web3-to-gaming-with-its-new-sdk-for-unity-developers-e6544bdf9ba9) and the [Technical details](https://github.com/aptos-labs/Aptos-Unity-SDK#technical-details) section of the Unity SDK README for all the features offered to game developers by the Aptos Unity SDK.

## User flows

The Aptos Unity SDK supports these use cases:

- _Progressive onboarding flow_ in which users can log into a game by email. In this flow, transactions are proxied, and Aptos uses a distributed key system. The users can then onboard to a full custodial wallet if desired.
- _In-game non-custodial wallet integration_ in which game developers have the option to allow users to create full non-custodial wallets in the games.
- _Off-game non-custodial wallet integration_ in which game developers may allow users to connect to a desktop wallet or a mobile wallet within the game or create burner wallets from the parent wallet seamlessly.
