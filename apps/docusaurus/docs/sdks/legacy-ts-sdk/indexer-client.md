The [IndexerClient](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/ecosystem/typescript/sdk/src/providers/indexer.ts) is responsible for handling the communication between the client-side application and the blockchain network. It uses the [Hasura framework](https://hasura.io/) to generate a set of [GraphQL queries](https://cloud.hasura.io/public/graphiql?endpoint=https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/graphql) that can be used to retrieve data from the blockchain. The queries are optimized for performance and can retrieve data in real-time.

## Usage

To use the `IndexerClient` class, you will need to create an instance of `IndexerClient` and call the desired API method. The `IndexerClient` object will handle the HTTP requests and responses and return the result to your application.

## Configuration

Before using the `IndexerClient` class, you will need to configure it with the necessary parameters. These parameters may include the Hasura endpoint URL, custom configuration, and any other required settings. You can configure the `IndexerClient` class by passing in the necessary parameters when you initialize the client object.

## Initialization

To initialize the `IndexerClient` class, you will need to pass in the necessary configuration parameters. Here is an example:

```ts
import { IndexerClient } from "aptos";

const client = new IndexerClient(
  "https://api.testnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/graphql",
);
```

## Make API fetch calls

To make an API call, you will need to call the appropriate method on the `IndexerClient` object. The method name and parameters will depend on the specific API you are using. Here is an example:

```ts
const accountNFTs = await client.getAccountNFTs("0x123");
```

In this example, we are using the `getAccountNFTs()` method to retrieve the NFT of an account with the address `0x123`.

## Use custom queries

The TypeScript SDK provides frequently used queries by different users and/or apps and makes sure the queries are well-structured to retrieve the current response.

With that being said, one can structure custom queries and use the SDK to query the Aptos Indexer API. For that, the SDK exports a `queryIndexer()` method that accepts a `GraphqlQuery` type argument. The `GraphqlQuery` type has a `query` field of type `string` and an optional `variable` field of an `object` type.

Here is the `GraphqlQuery` type definition.

```ts
type GraphqlQuery = {
  query: string;
  variables?: {};
};
```

To use the `queryIndexer()` method, one should pass the GraphQL query. For example:

```ts
const query: string = `query getAccountTokensCount($owner_address: String) {
  current_token_ownerships_aggregate(where: { owner_address: { _eq: $owner_address }, amount: { _gt: "0" } }) {
    aggregate {
      count
    }
  }
}`;
const variables = { owner_address: "0x123" };
const graphqlQuery = { query, variables };
const accountTokensCount = await client.queryIndexer(graphqlQuery);
```

:::tip
Be aware that it queries the network endpoint you passed in when initializing the `IndexerClient` class.

## Generate queries

To generate an Indexer query that can be used within the SDK, we can write a GraphQL query (based on the [Indexer schema](https://cloud.hasura.io/public/graphiql?endpoint=https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/graphql)) and use the SDK to generate a TypeScript query.

### Write an Indexer query

All Indexer queries, which are basically GraphQL queries, live under the `src/indexer/queries/` folder. In this folder, we create a `.graphql` file for each query we want the SDK to support. For example, a `.graphql` file with a GraphQL query can be:

```graphql
query getAccountTokensCount($owner_address: String) {
  current_token_ownerships_aggregate(
    where: { owner_address: { _eq: $owner_address }, amount: { _gt: "0" } }
  ) {
    aggregate {
      count
    }
  }
}
```

### Generate TypeScript queries

Once we have created a `.graphql` file with a GraphQL query, we can generate TypeScript code based on that query, so we can use it with the TypeScript SDK by running the following command:

```cmd
pnpm run indexer-codegen
```

That command runs the `graphql-codegen` command that generates code from the Indexer GraphQL schema based on the SDK configuration file.

### SDK GraphQL configuration file

The TypeScript SDK uses a configuration file for [@graphql-codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen), a code generation tool for GraphQL.

The SDK [configuration file](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/ecosystem/typescript/sdk/src/indexer/codegen.yml) defines how `@graphql-codegen` should generate TypeScript code from a GraphQL schema and queries. Let's break down some of the key elements of this file:

- `schema` – Specifies the location of the GraphQL schema file that `@graphql-codegen` should use for code generation. In this case, it is using the Aptos Indexer `mainnet` schema.
- `documents` - Specifies the location of the GraphQL operation files that `@graphql-codegen` should use for code generation. In this case, it is using the `src/indexer/queries/` location (as mentioned in the previous section) and includes all files with the `.graphql` extension.
- `generates` – Defines the output files that `@graphql-codegen` should generate based on the schema and operations. In this case, it is generating the types, operations and queries.
- `plugins` – Specifies the plugins that `@graphql-codegen` should use for code generation. In this case, it is using the `typescript` plugin to generate TypeScript typings from the GraphQL schema, `typescript-operations` plugin to generate TypeScript typings for GraphQL operations and `typescript-graphql-request` plugin to generate function for making GraphQL requests .

You can use the `IndexerClient` class directly or the [Provider](./sdk-client-layer.md) class (preferred).
