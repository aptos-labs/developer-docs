# Run a Local Multi-node Network

This guide describes how to run a local network with multiple validator nodes and validator fullnodes. You will use the [Aptos Forge CLI](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/main/testsuite/forge-cli/src) for this.

:::tip Use only for test networks
The method described in this guide should be used only for test networks of multi-node local networks. Do not use this guide for deploying in production environments. Currently, this is the only guide for multi-node networks.

For deploying a local network with a single node, see [Run a Local Development Network with the CLI](../guides/local-development-network.md).
:::

## Before you proceed

This guide assumes you have done the steps in [Building Aptos From Source](building-from-source.md)

## Running multiple validators

To deploy multiple local validators, run:

```bash
cargo run -p aptos-forge-cli \
        -- \
        --suite "run_forever" \
        --num-validators 4 test local-swarm
```

This will start a local network of 4 validators, each running in their own process. The network will run forever unless you manually terminate it.

The terminal output will display the locations of the validator files (for example, the genesis files, logs, node configurations, etc.) and the commands that were run to start each node. The process id (PID) of each node and server addresses (e.g., REST APIs) are also displayed when it starts. For example, if you run the above command you should see:

```bash
...
2022-09-01T15:41:27.228289Z [main] INFO crates/aptos-genesis/src/builder.rs:462 Building genesis with 4 validators. Directory of output: "/private/var/folders/dx/c0l2rrkn0656gfx6v5_dy_p80000gn/T/.tmpq9uPMJ"
...

...

2022-09-01T15:41:28.094825Z [main] INFO testsuite/forge/src/backend/local/node.rs:137 Node 0: REST API is listening at: http://127.0.0.1:64566

...
```

Using the information from this output, you can stop a single node and restart
it. For example, to stop and restart the node `0`, execute the below commands:

```bash
kill -9 <Node 0 PID>
cargo run -p aptos-node \
        -- \
        -f <Location to the node 0 configuration file displayed above>
```

## Faucet and minting

In order to mint coins in this test network you need to run a faucet. You can do that with this command:

```bash
cargo run -p aptos-faucet-service -- run-simple --key <key> --node-url <node_url>
```

You can get the values above like this:

- `key`: When you started the swarm, there was output like this: `The root (or mint) key for the swarm is: 0xf9f...`. This is the `key`.
- `node_url`: When you started the swarm, there was output like this: `REST API is listening at: http://127.0.0.1:64566`. This is the `node_url`.

The above command will run a faucet locally, listening on port `8081`. Using this faucet, you can then mint tokens to your test accounts, for example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8081/mint?amount=<amount to mint>&pub_key=<public key to mint tokens to>
```

As an alternative to using the faucet service, you may use the faucet CLI directly:

```
cargo run -p aptos-faucet-cli -- --amount 10 --accounts <account_address> --key <private_key>
```

:::tip Faucet and Aptos CLI
See more on how the faucet works in the [README](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/main/crates/aptos-faucet).

Also see how to use the [Aptos CLI](../tools/aptos-cli/use-cli/use-aptos-cli.md) with an existing faucet.
:::

## Validator fullnodes

To also run validator fullnodes inside the network, use the `--num-validator-fullnodes` flag. For example:

```bash
cargo run -p aptos-forge-cli \
        -- \
        --suite "run_forever" \
        --num-validators 3 \
        --num-validator-fullnodes 1 test local-swarm
```

## Additional usage

To see all tool usage options, run:

```bash
cargo run -p aptos-forge-cli --help
```
