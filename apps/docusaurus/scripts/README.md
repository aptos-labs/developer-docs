## Spellchecking

In order to spell check, you just need to run this from anywhere in `developer-docs`:

```
pnpm spellcheck
```

If you want to add a new word to the dictionary, you should add the word to `additional_dict.txt` and then run `sort -o additional_dict.txt additional_dict.txt`.

Note that aspell, at least as it is configured now, does not support adding words with numbers in them, such as `MultiEd25519`. Instead, you'd just want to add `MultiEd`.
