# Migrating from Docusaurus

This is designed as a self-help guide for those who are helping with the Docusaurus -> Nextra 
migration. I've summarized a few of the specific things to look out for when migrating docs.

## File Based Routing

<Callout>
**I highly recommend** viewing the section on [Organize Files](organize-files.mdx) and 
[Organize Files (Advanced)](organize-files-advanced.mdx) for more information
on how to setup routing in Nextra.
</Callout>

Docusaurus handles routing differently than Nextra. Namely, `_meta.ts(x)` is used to organize
the ordering of documents within a section. Each file includes an `export default` of the
mapping between the markdown file name (without the `.mdx` extension) and the title of the 
file (what shows up in the sidebar).

Here's an example:

```tsx filename="_meta.tsx"
export default {
  'migrating-from-docusaurus': "Migrating from Docusaurus",
  'organize-files': 'Organize Files',
  'organize-files-advanced': 'Organize Files (Advanced)',
  'docs-config': 'Docs Config',
  'SEO': 'SEO',
  'analytics': 'Analytics',
  'i18n': 'i18n',
  'maintenance': 'Maintenance',
  'deployment': 'Deployment',
  'troubleshooting': 'Troubleshooting',
}
```

## `.md` -> `.mdx`

Use `.mdx` instead of `.md` for file extensions when migrating.

## Links

Please use **relative** paths for links to other docs sections rather than **absolute** paths.

Absolute paths do not work well with `i18n` since we often have paths that are prefixed with the
localStorage, such as `/en/docs/setup/...`. 

## Codeblocks

In docusaurus, [Codeblock](../components/codeblock.mdx) components are rendered differently 
than in Nextra. When possible, try to add relevant `filename` information to help users understand
the context in which that code snippet is relevant.

For example, if the docs ask the user to use the `CLI`, instead of doing

````text
```bash
aptos install ...
```
````

you could add `filename="Terminal"` to the codeblock

````text
```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos install ...
```
````

which ultimately renders the following:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos install ...
```

## Callout

In docusaurus, [Callout](../components/callout.mdx) components are represented 
differently than in Nextra. Here is an example:

```md filename="staking.md"
<Callout type="info">
Currently, slashing is not implemented.
</Callout>
```

Here is the equivalent in Nextra

```mdx filename="staking.mdx"
import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

...

<Callout type="info">
Currently, slashing is not implemented.
</Callout>
```

## ThemedImage

You will often see usages of [ThemedImage](../components/themed-image.mdx) like so in docusaurus


```md filename="staking.md"
import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

...

<ThemedImage
  alt="Staking Flow"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/docs/staking-light.svg'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/docs/staking-dark.svg'),
  }}
/>
```

In Nextra the `useBaseUrl` hook is not needed. Images are placed in the `public` folder at the root
of the project. Thus, it should look something like this instead

```mdx filename="staking.mdx"
import { ThemedImage } from '@components/index'

...

<ThemedImage
  alt="Signed Transaction Flow"
  sources={{
    light: '/docs/stake-state.svg',
    dark: '/docs/stake-state-dark.svg',
  }}
/>
```

## Steps

A [Steps](../components/steps.mdx) component exists in Nextra that did not exist in docusaurus.
It helps to clearly layout a sequence of actions for the user, which we often
do throughout our docs. Content managers can take advantage of this to write clear, 
sequenced instructions.

Instead of

````md filename="node-health-checker.md"
### Step 1: Download the baseline configuration YAML

Download a baseline configuration YAML file for a devnet fullnode. The below command will download the `devnet_fullnode.yaml` configuration file:

```
mkdir /tmp/nhc
cd /tmp/nhc
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/main/ecosystem/node-checker/configuration_examples/devnet_fullnode.yaml
```

### Step 2: Start the NHC service

Start the NHC service by providing the above-downloaded `devnet_fullnode.yaml` baseline configuration YAML file:

```
docker run -v /tmp/nhc:/nhc -p 20121:20121 -t aptoslabs/node-checker:nightly /usr/local/bin/aptos-node-checker server run --baseline-config-paths /nhc/devnet_fullnode.yaml
```
````

You can instead do

````mdx filename="node-health-checker.mdx"
import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

...

<Steps>

### Download the baseline configuration YAML

Download a baseline configuration YAML file for a devnet fullnode. The below command will download the `devnet_fullnode.yaml` configuration file:

```bash filename="Terminal"
mkdir /tmp/nhc
cd /tmp/nhc
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/main/ecosystem/node-checker/configuration_examples/devnet_fullnode.yaml
```

### Start the NHC service

Start the NHC service by providing the above-downloaded `devnet_fullnode.yaml` baseline configuration YAML file:

```bash filename="Terminal"
docker run -v /tmp/nhc:/nhc -p 20121:20121 -t aptoslabs/node-checker:nightly /usr/local/bin/aptos-node-checker server run --baseline-config-paths /nhc/devnet_fullnode.yaml
```
</Steps>
````

This will render something like this:
