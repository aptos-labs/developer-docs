# Writing MDX

## Principles for Writing Great Documentation

Lee Robinson -- VP of Product at Vercel -- summarizes some best practices for writing great documentation [on his post on Developer Experience](https://leerob.io/blog/developer-experience#documentation). Many of the tips below are inspired by his blog:

**Optimize for skimming**: Let's face it, we all skim. Especially when reading developer documentation. My eyes jump directly to code blocks or diagrams / images, trying to find the solution to my given problem. 
To help provide the best DX, distill your content into the core content you need. Whenever possible, use diagrams or images as replacements for text.
[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is popular among developers for technical diagrams.

**Lead with code**: Developers want to write code. Give them code examples as starting blocks.

**Solve the problem (aka: answer the question)**: Developers come to docs to learn the answer to a question, challenge, or problem they're trying to resolve. Give them the answer through multiple methods 
(video, text, tutorials, guides, etc.), so they learn the solution in a way that works for them.

**Not just the happy path**: The documentation is a reference guide for developers trying to get work done. Often, this means searching for an error and looking for a solution they can copy/paste. 
It's important to document the workaround and hacks, too. I'd rather acknowledge a gap in the product and unblock the developer rather than leave them frustrated.

**Progressively expose complexity**: Consider putting content that's helpful for experts but not critical for the happy path in collapsible “deep dive” sections. 
Keep the first-time experience crisp while progressively informing developers about more complex features as they continue building with the product.


## Frontmatter

MDX documents support YAML [frontmatter](https://mdxjs.com/guides/frontmatter/) headers out of the box. This
section will discuss the frontmatter attributes that Nextra supports.

### `title`

Sets the title of the markdown document and affects BOTH the title included in the SEO card as well as the
title of the page (which can be found by hovering over the tab).

```mdx filename="example.mdx"

---
title: Hi, World!
---

# Hi, World!

```

### `searchable`

Will impact whether the document is indexed by Nextra during for flexsearch indices. If searchable is `false`,
the document and its contents will not be indexed and therefore will not be searchable.

By default, `searchable` is set to `true`

```mdx filename="example.mdx"

---
searchable: true
---

# Hi, World!

```
