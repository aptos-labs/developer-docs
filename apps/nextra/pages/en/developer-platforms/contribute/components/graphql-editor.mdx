# GraphQL Editor

`<GraphQLEditor />` is a custom component designed to be an interactive editor that enables users to make GraphQL queries to 
Aptos Labs' hosted Hasura indexer.

<GraphQLEditor
query={`query MyQuery {
  current_coin_balances(
    where: { 
      owner_address: {
        _eq: "0x239589c5cfb0cc96f76fa59165a7cbb6ef99ad50d0acc34cf3a2585d861511be"
      }
    }
  ) {
    owner_address
    amount
  }
}
`}
/>

## Core Features

The GraphQLEditor component includes several custom features that make it incredibly for developers to use

### Network Switch

Easily toggle between the public hasura endpoints for `mainnet`, `testnet`, and `devnet`. The network switch
is located in the top right corner of the GraphQL Editor.

### GraphQL Schema Docs

The component automatically handles the loading of the GraphQL schema, searching, and more without extra effort
from the docs writer.

Easily inspect the attributes of your query by holding `⌘` and clicking on an attribute or table name.

You can also search through the docs by clicking on the `Documentation Explorer` icon in the top right hand corner.

### Dark Mode

This component has been configured to work seamlessly with Nextra / Tailwind's dark mode and light mode without
requiring any extra effort on behalf of the docs writer.
