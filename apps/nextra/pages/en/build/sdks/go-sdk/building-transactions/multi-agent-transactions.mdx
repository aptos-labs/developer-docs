# Multi-Agent Transactions

Multi-agent transactions allow multiple accounts to participate in the logic of
a Move contract.

This can be used to require multiple parties agree to a transaction before
executing or to use resources from multiple accounts.

## Writing Multi-Agent Transactions

Creating and executing a multi-agent transaction follows a similar flow to the
[regular transaction flow](../building-transactions.mdx), but with several
notable differences.

<Callout type="info">
  Instead of `client.BuildTransaction`, multi-agent and sponsored transactions
  use `client.BuildTransactionMultiAgent`.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  ### Build the transaction by including `aptos.AdditionalSigners` with a list of each additional signers.

  <Callout type="info">
    Make sure to replace the `Function` field below with your entry function
    that requires multiple agents to sign.
  </Callout>

  ```go filename="multi_agent.go"
  transaction, err := client.BuildTransactionMultiAgent(alice.AccountAddress(), aptos.TransactionPayload{
    Payload: &aptos.EntryFunction{
      // Replace module and function with your multi-agent function
      Module: aptos.ModuleId{
        Address: aptos.AccountOne,
        Name:    "aptos_account",
      },
      Function: "transfer",
      ArgTypes: []aptos.TypeTag{},
      Args: [][]byte{
        accountBytes,
        amountBytes,
      },
    },
    AdditionalSigners: []aptos.AccountAddress{bob.AccountAddress()},
  })
  ```

  ### Sign once for each signer.

  You will combine these signatures in the next step.

  ```go filename="multi_agent.go"
  aliceAuth, err := rawTxn.Sign(alice)
  if err != nil {
      panic("Failed to sign transaction as sender:" + err.Error())
  }
  bobAuth, err := rawTxn.Sign(bob)
  if err != nil {
      panic("Failed to sign transaction as second signer:" + err.Error())
  }
  ```

  ### Combine the signatures with the raw transaction to create a multi-agent signed transaction.

  ```go filename="multi_agent.go"
  signedTxn, ok := rawTxn.ToMultiAgentSignedTransaction(aliceAuth, []crypto.AccountAuthenticator{bobAuth})
  ```
  ### Submit the transaction by combining all agent signatures via the `aptos.AdditionalSigners` parameter.

  ```go filename="multi_agent.go"
  submitResponse, err := client.SubmitTransaction(signedTxn)
  ```

  ### Lastly, wait for the transaction to resolve.

  ```go filename="multi_agent.go"
  txnResult, err := client.WaitForTransaction(submitResponse.Hash)
  ```
</Steps>

## Common Errors

`NUMBER_OF_SIGNER_ARGUMENTS_MISMATCH` - This happens when you are attempting to
do multi-agent signing for a function which does not require that number of
accounts. For example, if you try using multiple signatures for a
`0x1::aptos_account::transfer` function - it only expects one address, and so
produces an error when more than one is provided.
