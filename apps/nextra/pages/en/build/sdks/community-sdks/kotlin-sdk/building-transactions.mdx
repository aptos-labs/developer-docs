# Building and Sending Transactions

Kaptos boasts an expressive and type-safe DSL-style API for building and sending
transactions on-chain. This guide will walk you through the process of building
and sending transactions using Kaptos.

The typical flow for sending a transaction is as follows:

1. Create an account (if you don't already have one).
2. Build the transaction.
3. Sign the transaction.
4. Submit the transaction.

<Steps>
### Create an Account
  To create a new account, you first generate new credentials then fund the
  account. On test networks, you can fund an account programmatically by asking
  a "faucet".
```kotlin
val aliceAccount = Account.generate()
val bobAccount = Account.generate()
```
  OR

  If you have a private key, you can use it to create an `Account` object to manage
  those credentials.
```kotlin
val privateKey = Ed25519PrivateKey("myEd25519privatekeystring")
val account = Account.fromPrivateKey(privateKey)
```

### Build the Transaction
  Kaptos provides a `buildTransaction.simple` method to build a transaction. You can specify
  the sender, entry function data like the function name, type arguments, and function arguments.
  You can also configure the transaction with the gas price and maximum gas amount. However, reasonable
  defaults are provided for these values in case you don't specify them.

```kotlin
val txn = aptos.buildTransaction.simple(
    sender = aliceAccount.accountAddress,
    data = entryFunctionData {
        function = "0x1::coin::transfer"
        typeArguments = typeArguments {
            +TypeTagStruct("0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin")
        }
        functionArguments = functionArguments {
            +bobAccount.accountAddress
            +U64(SEND_AMOUNT)
        }
    },
)
```

### Sign the Transaction
  Once you have built a transaction, you can sign it using the `sign` method.
```kotlin
  val aliceAuthenticator = aptos.sign(
      sender = aliceAccount,
      transaction = txn,
  )
```

### Submit the Transaction
  Finally, you can submit the transaction to the network using the `submit` method.
```kotlin
val commitedTransaction = aptos.submitTransaction.simple(
      transaction = signedTransaction,
      senderAuthenticator = aliceAuthenticator,
)
```

  <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    You can collapse the signing and submitting steps into one by using the `signAndSubmitTransaction` method.

```kotlin
val executedTransaction = aptos.signAndSubmitTransaction(
      signer = aliceAccount,
      transaction = commitedTransaction,
)
```
  </Callout>

### Wait for the Transaction to Execute
  Then you can wait for the transaction to be executed by using the `waitForTransaction` method.
```kotlin
val executedTransaction = aptos.waitForTransaction(HexInput.fromString(commitedTransaction.expect("Transaction failed").hash))
```

</Steps>

### Full Kotlin Example

The following is a complete example of how to build and send a transaction to transfer APT:

```kotlin filename="transaction.kt"

const val FUNDING_AMOUNT = 100_000_000L
const val SEND_AMOUNT_APT = 0.5f
const val UNIT_CONVERSION = 100_000_000
const val SEND_AMOUNT_UNITS = (SEND_AMOUNT_APT * UNIT_CONVERSION)
const val SEND_AMOUNT = 1_000_000UL

/**
 * This example demonstrates how to transfer APT from one account to another.
 *
 * Each run generates and creates new accounts on-chain using faucet funding. After funding, the APT
 * balance of each account is printed; if funding fails, an error is thrown.
 *
 * Next, a transaction is constructed to send 0.5 APT from Alice to Bob. The transaction is then
 * signed and submitted using the one-step `signAndSubmitTransaction` method. We wait for the
 * transaction to complete and print the updated balances of Alice and Bob. If the transaction
 * fails, an error is thrown.
 */
fun main() = runBlocking {
  val aptos = Aptos(AptosConfig(AptosSettings(network = Network.TESTNET)))

  println("Generating Alice and Bob's accounts")

  val alice = Account.generate()
  val bob = Account.generate()

  aptos.fundAccount(alice.accountAddress, FUNDING_AMOUNT).expect("Failed to fund Alice's account")
  aptos.fundAccount(bob.accountAddress, FUNDING_AMOUNT).expect("Failed to fund Bob's account")

  println("Created accounts on chain")
  println("Alice's balance: ${aptos.getAccountAPTAmount(alice.accountAddress)}")
  println("Bob's balance: ${aptos.getAccountAPTAmount(bob.accountAddress)}")
  println("=============================================")
  println(
    "Building transaction to send ${SEND_AMOUNT / 100_000_000u} APT to Bob: ${bob.accountAddress}"
  )

  val txn =
    aptos.buildTransaction.simple(
      sender = alice.accountAddress,
      data =
        entryFunctionData {
          function = "0x1::coin::transfer"
          typeArguments = typeArguments { +TypeTagStruct("0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin") }
          functionArguments = functionArguments {
            +bob.accountAddress
            +U64(SEND_AMOUNT_UNITS.toULong())
          }
        },
    )

  // Sign and submit the transaction
  val commitedTransaction = aptos.signAndSubmitTransaction(alice, txn)

  val executedTransaction =
    aptos.waitForTransaction(
      HexInput.fromString(commitedTransaction.expect("Transaction failed").hash)
    )

  println(
    "Transaction wait response: $executedTransaction\n============================================="
  )

  val aliceNewBalance =
    aptos.getAccountAPTAmount(alice.accountAddress).expect("Alice's account does not exist")
  val bobNewBalance =
    aptos.getAccountAPTAmount(bob.accountAddress).expect("Bob's account does not exist")

  println("Alice's new balance: $aliceNewBalance")
  println("Bob's new balance: $bobNewBalance")
}

```
