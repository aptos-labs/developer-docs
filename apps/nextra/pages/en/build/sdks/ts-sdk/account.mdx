# Creating and Managing Accounts

There are several ways to generate account credentials using the TypeScript SDK. You can use:
- `Account.generate()`
- `Account.fromPrivateKey()`
- `Account.fromPrivateKeyAndAddress()`
- `Account.fromDerivationPath()`

`Account.generate()` is the most commonly used method to create keys for a new account. 
It defaults to `ED25519` key encodings, but you can also manually specify which signing scheme you would prefer like so:

```ts
const account = Account.generate(); // defaults to Legacy Ed25519
const account = Account.generate({ scheme: SigningSchemeInput.Secp256k1 }); // Single Sender Secp256k1
const account = Account.generate({
  scheme: SigningSchemeInput.Ed25519,
  legacy: false,
}); // Single Sender Ed25519
```

<Callout type="info">
Following [AIP-55](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-55.md) the SDK supports `Legacy` and `Unified` authentications. `Legacy` includes `ED25519` and `MultiED25519` and `Unified` includes `SingleSender` and `MultiSender` authenticators.
</Callout>

Once you have generated credentials, you **must** fund it for the network to know it exists. 

In test environments this can be done with a faucet by running the following command:

```ts filename="fund.ts"
const transaction = await aptos.fundAccount({
  accountAddress: account.accountAddress,
  amount: 100,
});
```

## Other Ways To Represent Accounts
If you have a private key, or equivalent representation, you can use that to create an `Account` object to manage those credentials while using the TypeScript SDK. 

Here are several examples that show how to do so with specific encoding schemes.

### Derive an account from private key

The SDK supports deriving an account from a private key with `fromPrivateKey()` static method.
This method uses a local calculation and therefore is used to derive an `Account` that has not had its authentication key rotated.

```ts
// to derive an account with a legacy Ed25519 key scheme
const privateKey = new Ed25519PrivateKey(privateKeyBytes);
const account = Account.fromPrivateKey({ privateKey });

// to derive an account with a Single Sender Ed25519 key scheme
const privateKey = new Ed25519PrivateKey(privateKeyBytes);
const account = Account.fromPrivateKey({ privateKey, legacy: false });

// to derive an account with a Single Sender Secp256k1 key scheme
const privateKey = new Secp256k1PrivateKey(privateKeyBytes);
const account = Account.fromPrivateKey({ privateKey });
```

### Derive an account from private key and address

The SDK supports deriving an account from a private key and address with `fromPrivateKeyAndAddress()` static method.

```ts
// to derive an account with a legacy Ed25519 key scheme
const privateKey = new Ed25519PrivateKey(privateKeyBytes);
const accountAddress = AccountAddress.from(address);
const account = Account.fromPrivateKeyAndAddress({
  privateKey,
  address: accountAddress,
  legacy: true,
});

// to derive an account with a Single Sender Ed25519 key scheme
const privateKey = new Ed25519PrivateKey(privateKeyBytes);
const accountAddress = AccountAddress.from(address);
const account = Account.fromPrivateKeyAndAddress({
  privateKey,
  address: accountAddress,
  legacy: false,
});

// to derive an account with a Single Sender Secp256k1 key scheme
const privateKey = new Secp256k1PrivateKey(privateKeyBytes);
const accountAddress = AccountAddress.from(address);
const account = Account.fromPrivateKeyAndAddress({
  privateKey,
  address: accountAddress,
});
```

### Derive an account from derivation path

The SDK supports deriving an account from derivation path with `fromDerivationPath()` static method.

```ts
// to derive an account with a legacy Ed25519 key scheme
const { mnemonic, address, path } = wallet;
const account = Account.fromDerivationPath({
  path,
  mnemonic,
  scheme: SigningSchemeInput.Ed25519,
});

// to derive an account with a Single Sender Ed25519 key scheme
const { mnemonic, address, path } = wallet;
const account = Account.fromDerivationPath({
  path,
  mnemonic,
  scheme: SigningSchemeInput.Ed25519,
  legacy: false,
});

// to derive an account with a Single Sender Secp256k1 key scheme
const { mnemonic, address, path } = wallet;
const account = Account.fromDerivationPath({
  path,
  mnemonic,
  scheme: SigningSchemeInput.Secp256k1Ecdsa,
});
```
