# Fetch Data via the TypeScript SDK

You can use the `Aptos` client to get on-chain data using a variety of helper functions. Specifically, many of the functions listed in the reference docs [here](https://aptos-labs.github.io/aptos-ts-sdk/@aptos-labs/ts-sdk-1.35.0/classes/Aptos.html) that start with `get...` will retrieve data from on-chain.

Here’s an example showing how to fetch common data you may need in your application:

```ts filename="fetch-data.ts"
const aptosConfig = new AptosConfig({ network: Network.DEVNET });
const aptos = new Aptos(aptosConfig);

const fund = await aptos.getAccountInfo({ accountAddress: "0x123" });
const modules = await aptos.getAccountModules({ accountAddress: "0x123" });
const tokens = await aptos.getAccountOwnedTokens({ accountAddress: "0x123" });
```

<Callout type="info">
Many queries have a parameter named `options` to customize the results, use it to get specifically what you are looking for.
</Callout>

The `Aptos` client can out of the box query both network data from [fullnodes](https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/) and the [Indexer](https://cloud.hasura.io/public/graphiql?endpoint=https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/graphql) API which contains aggregated and enriched data. If you want to use a custom query for Indexer API data, you can use `aptos.queryIndexer` like so:

```ts filename="fetch-data.ts"
  const ledgerInfo = await aptos.queryIndexer({
    query: {
      query: `
        query MyQuery {
          ledger_infos {
            chain_id
          }
        }
      `
    }
  })
```

## Using Generic Queries

Some queries are intentionally broad, but this can make inferring the proper return type difficult. To accommodate that, these broad requests like `getAccountResources` allow you to specify what the expected response type should be.

```ts filename="fetch-data.ts"
type Coin = { coin: { value: string } };

const resource = await aptos.getAccountResource<Coin>({
  accountAddress: testAccount.accountAddress,
  resourceType: "0x1::coin::CoinStore<0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin>",
});

// Now you have access to the response type property
const value = resource.coin.value;
```

## Using Move View Functions

You can call view functions which return custom data from on-chain by using `aptos.view`.

For example, you can look up the network you are using with the `chain_id` view function:

```ts filename="fetch-data.ts"
const payload: InputViewFunctionData = {
  function: "0x1::chain_id::get",
};

const chainId = (await aptos.view({ payload }))[0];
```

## Ensuring Fresh Indexer Data

Behind the scenes, some requests use the [Indexer API](../../indexer.mdx) to access data which has been processed or aggregated. That extra parsing can take a bit of time, so the data may lag slightly behind the latest ledger.

If you want to ensure that the data is fresh, you can specify the `minimumLedgerVersion` in any request which uses the Indexer API.

```ts filename="fetch-data.ts"
// Get the latest ledger version number
const ledgerVersion = await aptos.getLedgerInfo().ledger_version;

const tokens = await aptos.getAccountOwnedTokens({
  accountAddress: alice.accountAddress,
  minimumLedgerVersion: BigInt(response.version),
});
```

You can also ensure that your request has the data from a transaction you submitted by getting the ledger version from the transaction validation itself.

```ts filename="fetch-data.ts"
// Wait for a transaction you just submitted
const response = await aptos.waitForTransaction({
  transactionHash: pendingTransaction.hash,
});

// Then look up how that transaction affected alice's account
const tokens = await aptos.getAccountOwnedTokens({
  accountAddress: alice.accountAddress,
  minimumLedgerVersion: BigInt(response.version),
});
```
