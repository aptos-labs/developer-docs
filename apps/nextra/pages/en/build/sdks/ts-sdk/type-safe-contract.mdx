# Surf: Type Safety for your Move Contracts

## What is Surf

Surf is a TypeScript library built on top of the Aptos TypeScript SDK and Wallet Adaptor. It provides type safety for your Move contracts by <EXPLANATION HERE>.

## Usage

You first need to download the ABI of the Move contract you want to interact with. 

```bash filename="gen_abi.sh"
#! /bin/bash

NETWORK=testnet
# replace it with your contract address
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x12345
# replace it with your package name, you can find it in Move.toml
PACKAGE_NAME=fungible_asset_launchpad

echo "export const ABI = $(curl https://fullnode.$NETWORK.aptoslabs.com/v1/accounts/$CONTRACT_ADDRESS/module/$PACKAGE_NAME | sed -n 's/.*"abi":\({.*}\).*}$/\1/p') as const" > src/utils/abi.ts
```

Then you can use surf client as a replacement of the Aptos client when interact with Move contracts, both in frontend and node script. For non-contract related operations like managing account, querying indexer API, you still need to use Aptos client. 

```ts src/utils/aptos.ts
import { Aptos, AptosConfig, Network } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";
import { ABI } from "./abi";

const config = new AptosConfig({
  network: Network.TESTNET,
});
// You used to use aptosClient to interact with the chain
export const aptosClient = new Aptos(config);
// Now you use surfClient that wraps aptosClient to interact with Move contracts
export const surfClient = createSurfClient(aptosClient).useABI(ABI);
```
