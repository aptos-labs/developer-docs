# TypeScript SDK Example Code

For sample code which explains the core concepts of how to use the SDK, see:
 - [Fetching Data](fetch-data-via-sdk.mdx)
 - [Building, Simulating, and Submitting Transactions](building-transactions.mdx)

Below are additional resources which may be more suited for your individual use case.

## Code Snippets

The [`examples` folder](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-ts-sdk/tree/main/examples) in the SDK repo has dozens of code snippets you can customize to your needs. 

### How to run examples

To run one of the example scripts:
<Steps>
### Clone the [aptos-ts-sdk repository](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-ts-sdk)

```bash filename="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-ts-sdk.git
```

### From the top-level of the package, install all dependencies.

```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm install
```

### Build the package.

```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm build
```

### Go to the folder of an example you would like to run.

```bash filename="Terminal"
cd examples/typescript
```

### Install local dependencies.

```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm install
```

### Run the example.

```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm run simple_transfer
```
</Steps>
