# Invoke chains of Move calls with Dynamic Script Composer

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ℹ️">
Due to the current large bundle size of the ts-sdk, we are temporarily removing the Script Composer feature from the ts-sdk.

In the future, we will provide this feature as a separate extension package.

If you wish to continue using Script Composer, please install version 1.39.0:
[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aptos-labs/ts-sdk/v/1.39.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aptos-labs/ts-sdk/v/1.39.0)

In the naive api, you only get to specify one entry function to invoke for one transaction. An advanced builder might want to be able to invoke multiple **public** Move functions inside one transaction. This is now enabled by the new `scriptComposer` api provided in the transaction builder.

Here's an example of how you can invoke the api:

```ts filename="example.ts"
const transaction = await aptos.transaction.build.scriptComposer({
    sender: singleSignerED25519SenderAccount.accountAddress,
    // The builder expects a closure to build up the move call sequence.
    builder: async (builder) => {
        // invoke 0x1::coin::withdraw. This function would return a value of a `coin` type.
        const coin = await builder.addBatchedCalls({
            function: "0x1::coin::withdraw",
            functionArguments: [CallArgument.newSigner(0), 1],
            typeArguments: ["0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin"],
        });

        // Passing the coin value to the 0x1::coin::coin_to_fungible_asset to convert a coin
        // into fungible asset.
        const fungibleAsset = await builder.addBatchedCalls({
            function: "0x1::coin::coin_to_fungible_asset",
            // coin[0] represents the first return value from the first call you added.
            functionArguments: [coin[0]],
            typeArguments: ["0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin"],
        });

        // Deposit the fungibleAsset converted from second call.
        await builder.addBatchedCalls({
            function: "0x1::primary_fungible_store::deposit",
            functionArguments: [singleSignerED25519SenderAccount.accountAddress, fungibleAsset[0]],
            typeArguments: [],
        });
        return builder;
    },
});
```

Behind the scene, the SDK will invoke a WASM binary to compile the series of Move calls into a `CompiledScript`. This will guarantee that the type and ability safety of Move is still being honored during the construction process. For the SDK users, this means:
1. ability safety:
   a. If returned value does not have Drop ability, the returned value need to be consumed by subsequent calls.
   b. If returned value does not have Copy ability, the returned value can only be passed to subsequent calls once.
2. The caller will need to make sure they pass the right values as arguments to subsequent calls. In the previous example, `0x1::coin::coin_to_fungible_asset` will expect an argument of `Coin<AptosCoin>`.

This implements [AIP-102](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-102.md)
