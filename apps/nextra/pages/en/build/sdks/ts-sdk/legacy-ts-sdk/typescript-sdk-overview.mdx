# Legacy TypeScript SDK Architecture

import { ThemedImage } from '@components/index'

This document describes the main features and components of the Legacy Aptos TypeScript SDK.

The [Legacy Aptos TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/main/ecosystem/typescript/sdk) provides APIs and interfaces you can use to interact with the Aptos blockchain for reading the blockchain state and for sending your transaction to the Aptos blockchain.

The Legacy Aptos TypeScript SDK has three logical layers:

1. Client layer - Responsible on communication with the blockchain server.
2. Core layer - Exposes the functionalities needed by most applications.
3. Plugins layer - Implementation of different use cases such as Token, NFT, ANS, etc.

See below a high-level architecture diagram of the Legacy Aptos TypeScript SDK.
