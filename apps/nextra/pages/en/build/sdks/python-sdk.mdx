# Python SDK

Aptos provides a lightly maintained official Python SDK. It is available on
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/aptos-sdk/) with the source code in the
[aptos-python-sdk GitHub repository](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-python-sdk).
Much of the functionality of the Python SDK mirrors the [Typescript SDK](ts-sdk.mdx).
The primary purpose of the Python SDK is to help Python developers to quickly
become familiar with Aptos and as an accompaniment to Aptos tutorials.

## Installing Python SDK

The Python SDK can either be installed via `pip`, from source, or embedded:

### Install with pip

To install via `pip`:

```bash filename="Terminal"
pip3 install aptos-sdk
```

The `aptos-sdk` will be installed in the local site packages directory. For
example, on macOS, you will find the `aptos-sdk` in the
`~/Library/Python/3.8/lib/python/site-packages/aptos_sdk` directory.

### Install from the source code

To install from source:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-python-sdk
pip3 install . --user
```

### Install by embedding

To embed the Python SDK into your existing Python project:

```bash filename="Terminal"
cd /path/to/python/project
cp -r /path/to/aptos-python-sdk aptos-sdk
```

## Using the Python SDK

See the [Developer Tutorials](../guides.mdx) for code examples showing how to
use the Python SDK.
