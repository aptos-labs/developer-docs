# X-Chain Accounts

<Callout>
  The feature is currently only available on devnet and is considered an alpha version; therefore, you can expect breaking changes.
</Callout>


Thanks to [AIP-113 Derivable Account Abstraction](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-113.md), we can manage x-chain signatures flexibly and securely on the Aptos network.
This means that any wallet with an authentication function implementation on the Aptos chain can submit transactions to the Aptos network.

This functionality enables a variety of use cases for dApps, enhancing user experience and onboarding.

### High level flow

When a user enters a dApp that supports x-chain accounts, the interaction and experience feel the same as with any Aptos wallet.
The user connects with a x-chain account (e.g., Phantom for Solana) and can view their Derivable Abstracted Account (DAA) details, sign messages, and submit transactions to the Aptos chain.

When a dapp submits a transaction using a x-chain account, the wallet adapter utilizes the `signIn` function (defined in the x-chain account standard) for domain verification and security. If a specific wallet does not support the `signIn` method, the adapter falls back to using the default `signMessage`. 
The wallet is requested to sign a message to submit a transaction on the Aptos network. Once the wallet approves the transaction, it is submitted to the Aptos chain, where it undergoes a signature verification process.

### How does DAA work in a x-chain account?

When a user connects to a dApp using the x-chain account adapter, the adapter computes the user's Derivable Abstracted Account (DAA) address and converts the x-chain account to follow the Aptos wallet standard interface.
This ensures a seamless interaction with the wallet for both developers and end users.

The computation of the DAA address is done using the `authenticationFunction` and the `accountIdentity`, both of which are defined in the wallet adapter:

- `authenticationFunction`: This is a function that exists on-chain and is used to verify the signature of the x-chain account.
- `accountIdentity`: This represents the identity of the account used in the on-chain authentication function to verify the signature of the x-chain account.
In the Wallet Adapter, the `accountIdentity` is based on the original x-chain account's public key and the dApp domain (e.g., mydomain.com). The format is:
`${originWalletAddress}${domain}`

<Callout>
   Since the account identity is based on the dApp domain, it is scoped to the dApp context. As a result, each account has a different DAA address on different dApps.
</Callout>


### How to integrate x-chain accounts in my dApp?

Currently, the adapter supports Solana and EVM chains

<Callout>
  It is highly recommended to use the `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react` package for the best experience. Make sure you integrate with the Aptos Wallet Adapter by following these [steps](./dapp.mdx)
</Callout>

The wallet adapter follows the [Solana Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard/blob/master/DESIGN.md) to discover wallets.
Currently, the wallets that have been tested and support cross-chain accounts are:

|          | Aptos Devnet | Aptos Testnet | Aptos Mainnet |
|----------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| Phantom  | ✅           |                |
| Solflare | ✅           |                |
| Backpack | ✅           |                |
| OKX      | ✅           |                |


Supporting x-chain accounts in a dApp requires only a 2-step installation process.

<Steps>

### Install the `@aptos-labs/derived-wallet-solana` package

```bash
npm install @aptos-labs/derived-wallet-solana
```

### Import the `setupAutomaticSolanaWalletDerivation` function

Once you have installed the `@aptos-labs/derived-wallet-solana` package, you can import and use it.
In the same file where you import the other wallets, such as `WalletProvider.tsx`, you can add the following:

```tsx filename="WalletProvider.tsx"
import { setupAutomaticSolanaWalletDerivation } from "@aptos-labs/derived-wallet-solana";

setupAutomaticSolanaWalletDerivation({ defaultNetwork: Network.DEVNET }); // this is the Aptos network your dapp is working with

.....

<AptosWalletAdapterProvider
 dappConfig={{
    network: Network.DEVNET,
  }}
>
  {children}
<AptosWalletAdapterProvider/>
```
</Steps>

The wallet adapter follows the [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) to discover wallets.
Currently, the wallets that have been tested and support cross-chain accounts are:

|          | Aptos Devnet | Aptos Testnet  | Aptos Mainnet |
|----------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| Metamask | ✅           |                |
| Phantom  | ✅           |                |
| Coinbase | ✅           |                |
| OKX      | ✅           |                |
| Exodus   | ✅           |                |
| Backpack | ✅           |                |

That will handle the logic and implementation to include the x-chain accounts as if they were Aptos wallets.

#### Submitting a transaction

In most cases, allowing users to submit a transaction with a x-chain account to the Aptos chain requires using a sponsor transaction. This is because the x-chain account might not have APT to pay for gas.
Therefore, the dApp should consider maintaining a sponsor account to sponsor the transactions.

```tsx filename="SignAndSubmitDemo.tsx"
import React from 'react';
import { useWallet } from '@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react';
import { Aptos, AptosConfig, Network, Ed25519PrivateKey, PrivateKey, PrivateKeyVariants, Account } from '@aptos-labs/ts-sdk';

// Initialize an Aptos client
const config = new AptosConfig({ network: Network.DEVNET });
const aptos = new Aptos(config);

// Generate a sponsor account or use an existing account
const privateKey = new Ed25519PrivateKey(
  PrivateKey.formatPrivateKey(
    "0x123",
    PrivateKeyVariants.Ed25519
  )
);
const sponsor = Account.fromPrivateKey({ privateKey });

const SignAndSubmit = () => {
  const { account, signTransaction } = useWallet();

  const onSignAndSubmitTransaction = async () => {
    if(!account) {
      throw new Error("Account is not connected and unable to sign transaction")
    }

    try {
      // Build the transaction
      const rawTransaction = await aptos.transaction.build.simple({
        data: {
          function: "0x1::aptos_account::transfer",
          functionArguments: [account.address.toString(), 1],
        },
        sender: account.address,
        withFeePayer: true,
      });

      // Send it to the wallet to sign
      const walletSignedTransaction = await signTransaction({
        transactionOrPayload: rawTransaction,
      });

      // Sponsor account signs the transaction to pay for the gas fees
      const sponsorAuthenticator = aptos.transaction.signAsFeePayer({
        signer: sponsor,
        transaction: rawTransaction,
      });

      // Submit the transaction to chain
      const txnSubmitted = await aptosClient(network).transaction.submit.simple(
        {
          transaction: rawTransaction,
          senderAuthenticator: walletSignedTransaction.authenticator,
          feePayerAuthenticator: sponsorAuthenticator,
        }
      );

      // if you want to wait for transaction
      await aptos.waitForTransaction({ transactionHash: txnSubmitted.hash });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={onSignAndSubmitTransaction}>
      Sign and submit transaction
    </button>
  );
};

export default SignAndSubmit;
```

### Considerations
- Since the origin wallet creates an x-chain account and is most likely not integrated with Aptos, simulation is not available in the wallet.
- While the x-chain account prioritizes DAA, each account also retains the origin wallet, so developers should be able to use it and interact with it
