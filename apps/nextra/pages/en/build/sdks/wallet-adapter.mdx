# Wallet Adapter

There are two wallet adapter standards in the Aptos ecosystem:

1. [Aptos Wallet Adapter](#aptos-wallet-adapter) by Aptos Labs
2. [OKX Connect](#okx-connect) by OKX

## Aptos Wallet Adapter

The Aptos Wallet Adapter by Aptos Labs provides a single interface for Aptos
dapps and Aptos wallets to communicate with each other.

For dapp developers, this means that you can connect to any Aptos wallet that is
integrated with the Wallet Adapter without needing to write custom code for each
wallet.  This is described in [AIP-62](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-62.md),
which defines the Modern Wallet Standard and autodetection of wallets.

For Aptos wallet providers, integrating with AIP-62 means that your wallet will
be compatible with any dapp that uses the Wallet Adapter.

### For Aptos Dapps

Follow the [Wallet Adapter for Dapp Builders Guide](./wallet-adapter/dapp.mdx) on how to use the
Wallet Adapter (via the [Wallet Adapter React package](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter/tree/main/packages/wallet-adapter-react)).

### For Aptos Wallet Providers

Follow one of these guides for how to implement a Wallet Adapter plugin that
dapps can connect to:

1. For [Browser Extension Wallets](./wallet-adapter/browser-extension-wallets.mdx) (ex. [Petra](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/petra-aptos-wallet/ejjladinnckdgjemekebdpeokbikhfci?hl=en))
2. For [SDK Wallets](./wallet-adapter/wallets.mdx) (ex. [AptosConnect](https://aptosconnect.app))

## OKX Connect

The OKX Connect adapter provides an interface for Aptos dapps to connect to OKX
wallet and other wallets that support the OKX Connect standard.  You can find
more information about OKX Connect for Aptos dapps in the [OKX Connect documentation](https://web3.okx.com/build/dev-docs/sdks/app-connect-aptos)
