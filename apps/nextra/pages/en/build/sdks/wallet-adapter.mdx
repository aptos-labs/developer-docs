# Wallet Adapter

The Aptos Wallet Adapter provides a single interface for Aptos dapps and Aptos wallets to communicate with each other.

For app developers, this means that you can connect to an ever-growing list of Aptos wallets with a single integration. As new wallets enter the ecosystem and integrate with the Wallet Adapter, you can support them simply by updating your Wallet Adapter version.

For Aptos wallet providers, integrating with the Wallet Adapter allows you to be supported on a wide range of Aptos apps.

## For Aptos Dapps

Follow the [Wallet Adapter for Dapp Builders Guide](./wallet-adapter/dapp.mdx) on how to use the Wallet Adapter (via the [Wallet Adapter React package](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter/tree/main/packages/wallet-adapter-react)).

## For Aptos Wallet Providers

Follow one of these guides for how to implement a Wallet Adapter plugin that dapps can connect to:

1. For [Browser Extension Wallets](./wallet-adapter/browser-extension-wallets.mdx) (ex. [Petra](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/petra-aptos-wallet/ejjladinnckdgjemekebdpeokbikhfci?hl=en))
