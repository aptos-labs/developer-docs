# Ed25519 Accounts

The Aptos .NET SDK provides a simple way to create and manage Ed25519 accounts. In this guide we
will provide snippets of creating or importing existing accounts.

## Creating Ed25519Accounts

Ed25519Accounts are created to sign transactions and interact with the blockchain.

### Using a Private Key

To generate an account from a private key, you will need to create the `Ed25519PrivateKey` object and pass into into the
`Ed25519Account` constructor. The private key can be given a `string` or `byte[]` representation.

```csharp
var privateKey = new Ed25519PrivateKey("0x1234...abcdef");
var account = new Ed25519Account(privateKey);
```

### Using a Mneomonic Phrase

To generate an account from a phrase, you can use `Ed25519Account.FromDerivationPath` and pass in the phrase and the derivation path.
The derivation path that is typically used throughout the Aptos ecosystem is `m/44'/637'/0'/0'/0'`.

```csharp
var account = Ed25519Account.FromDerivationPath(
    "m/44'/637'/0'/0'/0'",
    "apple banana cat dog elephant fox ..."
);
```

### Generating a Random Account

To create a random account, you can use the `Account.Generate()` method.

```csharp
var account = Account.Generate();
```
