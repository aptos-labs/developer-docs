# Integrating into Unity projects

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating the Aptos .NET SDK.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  We are currently working on a `.unitypackage` for Unity developers. In the
  meantime, you can use the [NuGet](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity)
  package manager to install the SDK into your Unity project.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Install NuGetForUnity

1. Open Package Manager window (Window | Package Manager)
2. Click + button on the upper-left of a window, and select _Add package from git URL..._
3. Enter the following URL and click Add button

```
https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity.git?path=/src/NuGetForUnity
```

### Open NuGetForUnity and install the Aptos SDK

4. Click on `Manage NuGet Packages` from the `NuGet` menu in the Unity Editor.

</div>

5. Make sure to turn on `Show Prerelease` in the top left of the manager window.

</div>

### Use the Aptos SDK

7. Import the `Aptos` namespace in your C# script and use the SDK.

```csharp {2-2,8-8,11-15}
using UnityEngine;
using Aptos;

class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void Start()
    {
        PrintLedgerInfo();
    }

    async void PrintLedgerInfo() {
        var client = new AptosClient(Networks.Mainnet);
        var ledgerInfo = await client.Block.GetLedgerInfo();
        Debug.Log(ledgerInfo.BlockHeight);
    }

}
```

</Steps>
