# Creating and Managing Accounts

Kaptos provides a few ways to generate account credentials. You can either
generate a new account or derive an account from a private key.

### Generate a New Account

To create a new account, you can generate a new account credential using the
`Account.generate()` method. This method will create a new account with a new
key pair.

```kotlin
val account = Account.generate()
```

### Derive an Account from a Private Key

If you have a private key, you can use it to create an `Account` object to manage
those credentials.

```kotlin
val privateKey = Ed25519PrivateKey("myEd25519privatekeystring")

val account = Account.fromPrivateKey(privateKey)
```

Account generation does not create the account on-chain. You must fund the account
on-chain to use it for transactions. On test networks, you can fund an account
programmatically by asking a "faucet" for test tokens.

```kotlin
val fundedAccount = aptos.fundAccount(aliceAccount.accountAddress, FUNDING_AMOUNT)
```
