# AIP-88: Block Epilogue Transactions

[AIP-88](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-88.md) covers
block epilogue transactions, which are a new type of transaction that give
information about the block after it has been executed. These transactions can
only be created by the consensus and are not user-initiated.  They contain
information about gas usage in the block and will contain more information in
the future.

It replaces the previous `StateCheckpoint` transaction type, which was used to
"sometimes" signal the end of a block.  The new `BlockEpilogue` transaction is
now sometimes created at the end of a block instead, and it is guaranteed to be
the last transaction in the block.  The only case this does not apply is the
last block of an epoch, which will have no `BlockEpilogue` transaction.

## General FAQ
### What is in the Block Epilogue Transaction?

The block epilogue transaction contains a `BlockEndInfo` enum.  It is purposely
designed to be an enum so that it can be extended in the future without breaking
existing code.  The current version is `V0` and contains the following fields:

```move
module 0x1::epilogue {
  enum BlockEndInfo {
    V0 {
      /// Whether block gas limit was reached
      block_gas_limit_reached: bool,
      /// Whether block output limit was reached
      block_output_limit_reached: bool,
      /// Total gas_units block consumed
      block_effective_block_gas_units: u64,
      /// Total output size block produced
      block_approx_output_size: u64,
    },
  }
}
```

These mainly contain information about the gas usage in the block for debugging
purposes.

The JSON output will look like this:

```json
{
    "version":"1912",
    "hash":"0x54a8efc93fc94f5b545dadb63da3d4dc192125c717b336dc446d55a5b553913f",

}
```

## Compatibility FAQ
### What does this mean for my dApp?

If you process transactions in your dApp, and expect the last transaction in a
block to be a `StateCheckpoint`, you will need to update your code to handle the
`BlockEpilogue` transaction instead.

Note that, the `BlockEpilogue` transaction is guaranteed to be the last
transaction of a block except for the last block of an epoch, which will not
have a `BlockEpilogue` transaction.

### What apps are likely to be affected?

Apps that index all transactions such as block explorers and centralized
exchange indexer processors may be affected.  However, most of these are
informational and do not affect the core functionality of the dApp.

### What can I do to process the new transaction type?

If you're using the Aptos Go SDK or the Aptos TypeScript SDK, you can update to
the latest version, which will automatically handle the new transaction type.
