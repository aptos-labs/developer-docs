# AIP-115: Stateless Accounts

[AIP-115](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-115.md) covers
stateless accounts.

## General FAQ
### What is a Stateless Account?

A Stateless Account is a new behavior for Aptos accounts that allows them to
operate without requiring an explicitly created `0x1::account::Account` resource.
Instead, these accounts use default behaviors until an action necessitates the
creation of the resource. This change simplifies account management and reduces
unnecessary resource creation, making it easier for developers and users to
interact with the Aptos blockchain.

### How is it different from a regular account?

Technically, there is no separate account type. All accounts are the same under
the hood. The difference is that accounts without a resource behave in a
"stateless" manner using default values. The account resource is only created
on-demand when needed.

### How does it work?

When an account signs its first transaction sequence number transaction, it
will not have the `0x1::account::Account` resource created. Instead, it will
create the `0x1::account::Account` resource only when an action that requires to
increment the sequence number.

For an orderless transaction, the account resource is not needed at all, and the
account resource will not be created.

## Technical Details FAQ

### What is the default auth_key for Stateless Accounts?

If the `0x1::account::Account` resource does not exist, the auth_key defaults to
the account address itself. This allows the account to sign and submit
transactions without needing a resource.

### What is the sequence number of a Stateless Account?

It defaults to `0` if the account resource does not exist. In the future, with
Orderless Transactions, the sequence number may be eliminated entirely.

### When is the account resource automatically created?

The resource is created when an action that requires on-chain state, such as:
- Rotating the authentication key
- Using capabilities or features that rely on the account resource such as sequence number
- Explicitly calling functions that access fields in the account resource

### Does creating the account resource incur extra gas cost?

Yes. The creation of the resource is deferred, and the corresponding gas and
storage fees are only charged at the moment of actual creation, not beforehand.

### Any behavior change to account module at the Move level?

`0x1::account::exists_at` always returns true, as all on-chain account addresses
are considered valid and treated as existing by default. There is no move
function in the module to check whether the underlying account resource really
exists since the goal is to make it transparent to users. As a result, any logic
that first checks whether an account exists before attempting to create it is
now obsolete.

### Can users force-create the account resource upfront?

Yes. Users can explicitly call functions like
`0x1::account::create_account_if_does_not_exist` to create the resource
manually, if desired.

### Any behavior change to API?

If you rely on the following API behavior, please adjust correspondingly.
`GET /accounts/{address}` will never return “404 not found” but the default
authentication key and sequence number mentioned above for stateless accounts.
Therefore, if it is desired to check whether the account resource exists or not,
try `GET /accounts/{address}/resource/0x1::account::Account`

### Do existing accounts get affected?

No. Existing accounts with resources already created will continue to work
exactly as they do now. Stateless Account behavior only applies to accounts that
have not yet created a resource.


### Do dApps / CEX need to change anything?

Maybe. Previously, checking whether an account existed often relied on calling
APIs that return a 404 error if the account resource was not found. Applications
would then use this as a signal to warn users (e.g., "This account does not
exist"). Under the new model, all addresses are considered valid, and such
404-based existence checks are no longer reliable or meaningful. However, we are
not banning this pattern—developers may still choose to warn users that an
account may not have performed any on-chain activity and thus might not have a
resource created yet.

If you still want to detect whether an account has an associated resource, you
can refer to the method described in Q9 or check whether the sequence_number is
0. But be aware that with the introduction of orderless transactions, some
accounts may only submit transactions that never create a resource, which could
result in false negatives.

We recommend designing your application to be robust regardless of whether the
account resource exists, and to avoid assuming resource presence as a proxy for
account existence.

Examples:
- A wallet might check for an account to see if it’s a new account, and provide
a user a warning.  With this change, instead a mitigation like Q9 will be needed.
- A custodial wallet may send funds to initialize an account with gas.  With
this change, it will need to check the account’s balance instead of just the
account existing.

### Is this compatible with Orderless Transactions?

Yes. Orderless Transactions and Stateless Accounts are complementary. Once
Orderless Transactions are enabled, sequence numbers will no longer be needed,
enabling truly stateless usage.

## Will all accounts become Stateless in the future?

No. Stateless Accounts are not a new account type. It simply allows accounts to
behave with default logic until the account resource is needed. This lazy
resource creation, does not transform existing account state. All accounts can
behave in a stateless way by default, but they will still create the standard
resource if and when advanced features are used.
