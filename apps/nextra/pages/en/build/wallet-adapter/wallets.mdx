# Wallet Adapter For Wallet Builders

To gain from dapps in the Aptos Ecosystem and provide your users the
functionality they are looking for in a wallet, your wallet plugin should follow
the [Aptos Wallet Standard](wallets.mdx) and be built from the Aptos
Wallet Adapter.

The [wallet-adapter-plugin-template](https://github.com/aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-plugin-template)
repository gives wallet builders a pre-made class with all required wallet
functionality following the Aptos Wallet Standard for easy and fast development.

## Configuration

1. `git clone git@github.com:aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-plugin-template.git`
2. Open `src/index.ts` for editing.
3. Replace all `AptosWindow` references with: `<Your-Wallet-Name>Window`
4. Replace `AptosWalletName` with: `<Your-Wallet-Name>WalletName`
5. Replace `url` with your website URL.
6. Change `icon` to your wallet icon (pay attention to the required format).
7. Replace `window.aptos` with: `window.<your-wallet-name>`

- Make sure the `Window Interface` has `<your-wallet-name>` as a key (instead
of `aptos`).

8. Open `__tests/index.test.tsx` and change `AptosWallet`
to: `<Your-Wallet-Name>Wallet`
9. Run tests with `pnpm test` - all tests should pass.

At this point, you have a ready wallet class with all required properties and
functions to integrate with the Aptos Wallet Adapter.

### Publish as a package

The next step is to publish your wallet as an NPM package so dapps can install
it as a dependency. Use one of the options below:

[Creating and publishing scoped public packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages)

[Creating and publishing unscoped public packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-unscoped-public-packages)

<Callout type="info">
  If your wallet provides functionality that is not included, you should open a
  pull request against `aptos-wallet-adapter` in the core package to have it
  support this functionality. See the `signTransaction` on
  the [wallet core
  package](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter/blob/main/packages/wallet-adapter-core/src/WalletCore.ts)
  for guidance.
</Callout>

### Add your name to the wallets list

Once the package is published, create a pull request against
the [aptos-wallet-adapter](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter)
package and add your wallet name to
the [supported wallet list](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter#supported-wallet-packages)
on the README file as a URL to your NPM package.

## AIP-62 Wallet Standard

The AIP-62 Wallet Standard is a chain-agnostic set of interfaces and conventions
that aim to improve how applications interact with injected wallets. Read more
about
it [here](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-62.md).

### Why integrating with the AIP-62 wallet standard?

<Callout type="info">
In the near future and as wallets onboard to the new standard, the wallet
adapter will deprecate the legacy standard and keep only the AIP-62 wallet
standard support.
</Callout>

The AIP-62 wallet standard eliminates the current issues wallets have:

- Relying solely on a dapp detecting process logic can create a race condition
risk in the case the dapp loads before a wallet and the dapp is not aware of
the new wallets
- The legacy standard is deeply integrated within the Aptos wallet adapter, and
any change can cause breaking changes for dApps and wallets, creating endless
maintenance work by requiring a dApp or wallet to implement these changes.
- The legacy standard supports only the legacy TS SDK input, types, and logic.
That means that it doesn't enjoy the features and enhancements of the new TS
SDK. In addition, the legacy TS SDK does not receive any more support or new
features.

In addition, the new wallet standard described in AIP-62 provides many benefits
to wallets:

- Wallet owns and controls its own interface and can easily update and provide
new features without introducing any breaking change to the dapp
- The wallet integration code lives in the wallet codebase and does not require
a wallet to create and maintain another wallet package
- Wallets dont need to rely on dapps to install and maintain its wallet package
- The AIP-62 wallet standard provides better validation and error handling
support, and uses the new TS SDK which is more reliable, fast and actively
maintained and developed with new features (the legacy sdk, i.e aptos, is no
longer actively maintained and developed).

## How to integrate with the AIP-62 wallet standard?

<Callout type="info">
  Aptos provides
  a [@aptos-labs/wallet-standard](https://github.com/aptos-labs/wallet-standard)
  package that holds the standard interface and class a wallet should implement.
  In addition, it provides helper functions to detect Aptos compatible wallets.
</Callout>

Integrating with the AIP-62 wallet standard is pretty simple and
straightforward. For more information, users can refer
to [this example](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter/blob/main/apps/nextjs-example/utils/standardWallet.ts)
to learn how to integrate with the new wallet standard.

<Callout type="info">
To be compatible with AIP-62 wallet standard and for be able to be detected by
dapps, wallets must implement and
support [required features](https://github.com/aptos-labs/wallet-standard/blob/main/src/detect.ts#L16)
</Callout>

### AptosWallet interface implementation

A wallet must implement an `AptosWallet` interface with the wallet provider info
and features:

```ts
import { AptosWallet } from "@aptos-labs/wallet-standard";

class MyWallet implements AptosWallet {
  url: string;
  version: "1.0.0";
  name: string;
  icon:
    | `data:image/svg+xml;base64,${string}`
    | `data:image/webp;base64,${string}`
    | `data:image/png;base64,${string}`
    | `data:image/gif;base64,${string}`;
  chains: AptosChain;
  features: AptosFeatures;
  accounts: readonly AptosWalletAccount[];
}
```

### AptosWalletAccount interface implementation

A wallet must implement a AptosWalletAccount interface that represents the
accounts that have been authorized by the dapp.

```ts
import {
  AptosWalletAccount,
  IdentifierArray,
} from "@aptos-labs/wallet-standard";
import { SigningScheme } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";

class MyWalletAccount implements AptosWalletAccount {
  address: string;

  publicKey: Uint8Array;

  chains: IdentifierArray;

  features: IdentifierArray;

  signingScheme: SigningScheme;

  label?: string;

  icon?:
    | `data:image/svg+xml;base64,${string}`
    | `data:image/webp;base64,${string}`
    | `data:image/png;base64,${string}`
    | `data:image/gif;base64,${string}`
    | undefined;

  constructor(account: Account) {
    this.address = account.accountAddress.toString();
    this.publicKey = account.publicKey.toUint8Array();
    this.chains = APTOS_CHAINS;
    this.features = ["aptos:connect"];
    this.signingScheme = SigningScheme.Ed25519;
  }
}
```

### Register Wallet

#### Web extension wallet

A wallet registers itself using the registerWallet method to notify the dapp it
is ready to be registered.

```ts
import { registerWallet } from "@aptos-labs/wallet-standard";

const myWallet = new MyWallet();

registerWallet(myWallet);
```

## My wallet is compatible with the AIP-62 standard, now what?

If your wallet supports the AIP-62 Standard, you should be able to include it with the [aptos-wallet-adapter](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter) tool for a broad ecosystem visibility and support.

### Is your wallet a chrome extension wallet?

If your wallet is a chrome extension based wallet, please open up a PR against the [aptos-wallet-adapter](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter) repo and add your wallet to the [Adapter Wallet Registry](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter/blob/main/packages/wallet-adapter-core/src/AIP62StandardWallets/registry.ts#L15) so the tool can detect the wallet even if it is not installed on the user machine

### Is your wallet a SDK (npm package) wallet?

If your wallet is a SDK based wallet, please open up a PR against the [aptos-wallet-adapter](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter) repo and

- Add the wallet npm package as a dependency in the [adapter-core package](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter/blob/main/packages/wallet-adapter-core/package.json)
- Import your wallet and add it to the wallets array in the [adapter-core-package](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-wallet-adapter/blob/main/packages/wallet-adapter-core/src/AIP62StandardWallets/sdkWallets.ts#L6)

This will make sure you wallet is being added to the Adapter SDK Wallets list so the tool can add your wallet as part of the all suggested wallets
