# Orderless Transactions

As outlined
in [AIP-123](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-123.md),
orderless transactions allow for transactions to be executed out of order, which
is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple machines need to sign for a
single sending account, but the order in which they sign does not affect the
outcome of the transaction or matter to the creator.  Replay is protected by a
nonce, which is a unique identifier for a transaction.  This allows for the
transaction to be executed at any time within the expiration time, regardless of
the order in which the machines sign the transaction, but not be able to be
replayed after the nonce has expired.  The maximum expiration time is 60 seconds
for orderless transactions, which is not the same for sequence number
transactions.

## Process Overview

Orderless transactions are dependent on the transaction payload specified in
[AIP-129](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-129.md).
The process for building and executing an orderless transaction is as follows:

1. Build a transaction with a `replayProtectionNonce` and a `TransactionPayload::TransactionPayloadPayload` that defines the operation to be executed.
2. Sign and submit the transaction as any other transaction, but with the
`replayProtectionNonce` set.  Ideally, the nonce should be a random u64 value.

Note, that the behavior of the `replayProtectionNonce` is similar to a sequence
number, but it does not guarantee ordered execution of transactions. Instead, it
ensures that the transaction is unique and cannot be replayed (executed twice)
with the same nonce.

## SDK Support

These are demonstrations of sponsored transactions:

- The [TypeScript SDK](../sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions/orderless-transactions.mdx) has documentation
- The [Go SDK](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-go-sdk/tree/main/examples/orderless_transaction) has an example
