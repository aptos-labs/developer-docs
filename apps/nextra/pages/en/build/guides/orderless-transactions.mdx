# Orderless Transactions

As outlined
in [AIP-123](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-123.md),
orderless transactions allow for transactions to be executed out of order, which
is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple machines need to sign for a
single sending account, but the order in which they sign does not affect the
outcome of the transaction or matter to the creator.  Replay is protected in

## Process Overview

Orderless transactions are dependent on the transaction payload specified in
[AIP-129](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-129.md).
The process for building and executing an orderless transaction is as follows:

1. Build a transaction with a `replayProtectionNonce` and a `TransactionPayload::TransactionPayloadPayload` that defines the operation to be executed.
2. Sign and submit the transaction as any other transaction, but with the
`replayProtectionNonce` set.

Note, that the behavior of the `replayProtectionNonce` is similar to a sequence
number, but it does not guarantee ordered execution of transactions. Instead, it
ensures that the transaction is unique and cannot be replayed (executed twice)
with the same nonce.

## SDK Support

These are demonstrations of sponsored transactions:

- The [TypeScript SDK](../sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions/orderless-transactions.mdx) has documentation
- The [Go SDK](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-go-sdk/tree/main/examples/orderless_transaction) has an example
