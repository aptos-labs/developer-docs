# Account Key Rotation

<Callout type="warning">
  Account key rotation is an advanced feature that should be used with caution.
  Most users will never need to use this feature.
</Callout>

Aptos Move accounts have a public address, an authentication key, a public key,
and a private key. The public address is permanent, always matching the
account's initial authentication key.

The Aptos account model facilitates the unique ability to rotate an account's
private key. Since an account's address is the _initial_ authentication key, the
ability to sign for an account can be transferred to another private key without
changing its public address.

In this guide, we show examples of how to rotate an account's authentication key
using a few of the various Aptos SDKs.

Here are the installation links for the SDKs we will cover in this example:

- [Aptos CLI](../cli.mdx)
- [Typescript SDK](../sdks/ts-sdk.mdx)
- [Python SDK](../sdks/python-sdk.mdx)

<Callout type="warning">
  Some of the following examples use private keys. Do not share your private
  keys
  with anyone.

## How to rotate an account's authentication key

### Aptos CLI
    Run the following to initialize two test profiles. Leave the inputs blank
    both times you're prompted for a private key.

    {/*TODO: something is wrong with code caching<Steps>*/}
      ### Initialize two test profiles on devnet
      ```bash filename="Terminal"
      aptos init --profile test_profile_1 --network devnet --assume-yes
      aptos init --profile test_profile_2 --network devnet --assume-yes
      ```

      ### Rotate the authentication key for test_profile_1 to test_profile_2's
      authentication key
      ```bash filename="Terminal"
      aptos account rotate-key --profile test_profile_1
      --new-private-key [TEST_PROFILE_2_PRIVATE_KEY]
      ```


      <Callout type="info">
        ### Where do I view the private key for a profile?
        Public, private, and authentication keys for Aptos CLI profiles are
        stored
        in `~/.aptos/config.yaml` if your config is set to `Global`
        and `
        [local_directory]/.aptos/config.yaml` if it's set to `Workspace`. To
        see your config settings, run `aptos config show-global-config`.
      </Callout>

      ### Confirm yes and create a new profile so that you can continue to sign
      for the resource account
      ```bash filename="Terminal"
      Do you want to submit a transaction for a range of [52000 - 78000] Octas
      at a gas unit price of 100 Octas? [yes/no] >
      yes
      ...

      Do you want to create a profile for the new key? [yes/no] >
      yes
      ...

      Enter the name for the profile
      test_profile_1_rotated

      Profile test_profile_1_rotated is saved.
      ```

      You can now use the profile like any other account.

      In your `config.yaml` file, `test_profile_1_rotated` will retain its
      original public address but have a new public and private key that
      matches `test_profile_2`.

      The authentication keys aren't shown in the `config.yaml` file, but we can
      verify the change with the following commands:

      ### Verify the authentication keys are now equal with view functions
      ```bash filename="Terminal"
      # View the authentication key of `test_profile_1_rotated`
      aptos move view --function-id 0x1::account::get_authentication_key --args
      address:test_profile_1_rotated

      # View the authentication key of `test_profile_2`, it should equal the
      above.
      aptos move view --function-id 0x1::account::get_authentication_key --args
      address:test_profile_2
      ```

      ### Example output from the previous two commands
      ```bash filename="Terminal"
      {
        "Result": [
        "0x458fba533b84717c91897cab05047c1dd7ac2ea73e75c77281781f5b7fec180c"
        ]
      }
      {
        "Result": [
        "0x458fba533b84717c91897cab05047c1dd7ac2ea73e75c77281781f5b7fec180c"
        ]
      }
      ```
    {/*</Steps>*/}

### TypeScript
    This program creates two accounts on devnet, Alice and Bob, funds them, then
    rotates the Alice's authentication key to that of Bob's.

    View the full example for this code
    [here](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/ecosystem/typescript/sdk/examples/typescript-esm/rotate_key.ts).

    The function to rotate is very simple:

    {/* TODO CODE EXAMPLE */}

    Commands to run the example script:

    ### Navigate to the typescript SDK directory, install dependencies and run
    rotate_key.ts
    ```bash filename="Terminal"
    cd ~/aptos-core/ecosystem/typescript/sdk/examples/typescript-esm
    pnpm install && pnpm rotate_key
    ```

    ### rotate_key.ts output
    ```shell filename="Terminal"
    Account Address Auth Key Private Key Public Key
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Alice 0x213d...031013 '0x213d...031013' '0x00a4...b2887b' '0x859e...08d2a9'
    Bob 0x1c06...ac3bb3 0x1c06...ac3bb3 0xf2be...9486aa 0xbbc1...abb808

    ...rotating...

    Alice 0x213d...031013 '0x1c06...ac3bb3' '0xf2be...9486aa' '0xbbc1...abb808'
    Bob 0x1c06...ac3bb3 0x1c06...ac3bb3 0xf2be...9486aa 0xbbc1...abb808
    ```

### Python
    This program creates two accounts on devnet, Alice and Bob, funds them, then
    rotates the Alice's authentication key to that of Bob's.

    View the full example for this code
    [here](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/ecosystem/python/sdk/examples/rotate_key.py).

    Here's the relevant code that rotates Alice's keys to Bob's:

    {/* TODO CODE EXAMPLE */}

    Commands to run the example script:

    ### Navigate to the python SDK directory, install dependencies and run
    rotate_key.ts
    ```bash filename="Terminal"
    cd aptos-core/ecosystem/python/sdk
    poetry install && poetry run python -m examples.rotate-key
    ```

    ### rotate_key.py output
    ```bash filename="Terminal"
    Account Address Auth Key Private Key Public Key
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Alice 0x213d...031013 '0x213d...031013' '0x00a4...b2887b' '0x859e...08d2a9'
    Bob 0x1c06...ac3bb3 0x1c06...ac3bb3 0xf2be...9486aa 0xbbc1...abb808

    Alice 0x213d...031013 '0x1c06...ac3bb3' '0xf2be...9486aa' '0xbbc1...abb808'
    Bob 0x1c06...ac3bb3 0x1c06...ac3bb3 0xf2be...9486aa 0xbbc1...abb808
