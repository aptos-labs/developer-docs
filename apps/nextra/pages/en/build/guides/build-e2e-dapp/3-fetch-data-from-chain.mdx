# 3. Fetch Data from Chain

In the third chapter of the tutorial on [building an end-to-end dapp on Aptos](../build-e2e-dapp.mdx), you will be learning to fetch data from chain.

Our UI logic relies on whether the connected account has created a todo list. If the account has created a todo list, our app should display that list; if not, the app should display a button offering the option to create a new list.

For that, we first need to check if the connected account has a `TodoList` resource. In our smart contract, whenever someone creates a todo list we create and assign a `TodoList` resource to their account.

To fetch data from chain, we can use the [Aptos TypeScript SDK](../../sdks/ts-sdk.mdx). The SDK provides classes and functions for us to easily interact and query the Aptos chain.

To get started:

1. Stop the local server if running.
2. Import wallet from the wallet adapter React provider:

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
import { useWallet } from "@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react";
```

2. Extract the account object from the wallet adapter:

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
function App (
	const { account } = useWallet();
)
```

The `account` object is `null` if there is no account connected; when an account is connected, the `account` object holds the account information, including the account address.

3. Next, we want to fetch the account’s TodoList resource.
   Begin by importing `useEffect` by using `import { useEffect } from "react";`
   Let’s add a `useEffect` hook to our file that would call a function to fetch the resource whenever our account address changes:

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
function App() {
  import { useEffect } from "react"
  ...
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchList();
  }, [account?.address]);
  ...
}
```

4. Before creating our `fetchList` function, let’s also create a local state to store whether the account has a list:

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
function App (
  ...
  const [accountHasList, setAccountHasList] = useState<boolean>(false);
  ...
)
```

also import `useState` using
`import { useState, useEffect } from "react";` 

5. Import `MODULE_ADDRESS` variable using `import { MODULE_ADDRESS } from "./constants";`. This is the address of the module we published in the previous chapter.
6. Import `aptosClient` using `import { aptosClient } from "./utils/aptosClient";`. This is a client `create-aptos-dapp` created for us to interact with the chain.
7. Our `useEffect` hook is calling a `fetchList` function; let’s create it:

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
const fetchList = async () => {
  if (!account) return [];
  const moduleAddress = MODULE_ADDRESS;
  try {
    const todoListResource = await aptosClient().getAccountResource(
      {
        accountAddress:account?.address,
        resourceType:`${moduleAddress}::todolist::TodoList`
      }
    );
    setAccountHasList(true);
  } catch (e: any) {
    setAccountHasList(false);
  }
};
```

The `aptosClient().getAccountResource()` expects an _account address_ that holds the resource we are looking for and a string representation of an on-chain _Move struct type_.

- account address - is the current connected account (we are getting it from the wallet account object)
- Move struct type string syntax:
  - The account address who holds the move module
  - The module name the resource lives in = `todolist`
  - The resource name = `TodoList`

If the request succeeds and there is a resource for that account, we want to set our local state to `true`; otherwise, we would set it to `false`.

7. Let’s update our UI based on the `accountHasList` state:

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
return (
  <>
    <TopBanner />
    <Header />
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center flex-col">
      {!accountHasList && (
        <div className="flex items-center justify-center flex-col">
          <Button>Add new list</Button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  </>
);
```

We now have an **Add new list** button that appears only if the account doesn’t have a list.

Start the local server with `npm run dev`. You should see the **Add new list** button.

Next, let’s understand how to create a new list by [submitting data to chain](4-submit-data-to-chain.mdx) in chapter 4.
