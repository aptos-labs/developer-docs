# 2. Set up the frontend

This is the second chapter of the tutorial on [building an end-to-end dapp on Aptos](../build-e2e-dapp.mdx) where you have already [created a smart contract](1-create-smart-contract.mdx) and are now setting up the frontend.

## Set up the frontend

`create-aptos-dapp` has already created the frontend for us with a basic layout and Wallet implementation using the `aptos-wallet-adapter` library.

1. Run: `npm run dev` 

   At this point you should have your app running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173), which displays the default template layout.

2. In the `frontend` directory, find all the frontend files. Letâ€™s clean it up a bit.
3. Open the `App.tsx` file and update its content to be:

```ts filename="App.tsx"
import { Header } from "@/components/Header";
import { TopBanner } from "@/components/TopBanner";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <TopBanner />
      <Header />
      <div className="flex items-center justify-center flex-col">
        <div>My app goes here</div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;

```

Once you save the changes, you should see that the app content has changed in the browser and displays `My app goes here`.

## Our dapp UI

First we will build the dapp UI layout. We have two UI states for the app:

- When an account hasn't created a list yet (on the left).
- When an account has created a list and can now add tasks to it (on the right).

We now have a working client with a Wallet connect button and a wallet selector modal. Feel free to play with it and connect a wallet with it.

Then learn how to [fetch data from chain](3-fetch-data-from-chain.mdx) in chapter 3.
