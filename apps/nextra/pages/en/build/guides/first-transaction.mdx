# Your First Transaction

Transactions are the fundamental way to change data on the Aptos blockchain. Think of them like sending a package: you need to specify what you're sending, who it's going to, and then track it until delivery is confirmed. In blockchain terms, transactions allow you to transfer coins, call smart contract functions, and update on-chain state.

This tutorial will guide you through creating and submitting your first transaction on the Aptos blockchain. You'll learn how to:

1. Set up your development environment
2. Create test accounts and fund them
3. Build a transaction to transfer coins
4. Simulate the transaction to estimate costs
5. Sign and submit the transaction
6. Verify the transaction was executed successfully

<Callout type="info">
This tutorial builds on concepts from the Aptos blockchain. If you're new to blockchain development, don't worry - we'll explain key concepts along the way.

## 1. Setting Up Your Environment

<Tabs items={["TypeScript", "Python"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

  Before we can create transactions, we need to set up our development environment with the necessary tools and SDKs.

  <Steps>

  ### Install the TypeScript SDK

  Install the TypeScript SDK using your preferred package manager:

  <Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  npm install @aptos-labs/ts-sdk
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  yarn add @aptos-labs/ts-sdk
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  pnpm add @aptos-labs/ts-sdk
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ### Create a project directory

  Create a new directory for your project:

  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  mkdir my-first-transaction
  cd my-first-transaction
  ```

  ### Create a new file

  Create a new file named `transaction.ts`:

  <Tabs items={["Mac/Linux", "Windows"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  touch transaction.ts
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  type nul > transaction.ts
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>
  </Steps>

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

  Before we can create transactions, we need to set up our development environment with the necessary tools and SDKs.

  <Steps>

  ### Install the Python SDK

  Install the Python SDK using pip:

  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  pip install aptos-sdk
  ```

  ### Create a project directory

  Create a new directory for your project:

  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  mkdir my-first-transaction
  cd my-first-transaction
  ```

  ### Create a new file

  Create a new file named `transaction.py`:

  <Tabs items={["Mac/Linux", "Windows"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  touch transaction.py
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  type nul > transaction.py
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>
  </Steps>

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## 2. Creating Test Accounts

<Tabs items={["TypeScript", "Python"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

  In blockchain, all transactions must come from an account. Let's create two test accounts: one to send coins (Alice) and one to receive them (Bob).

  <Steps>

  ### Set up the client

  First, we need to initialize the Aptos client that will connect to the blockchain. Open `transaction.ts` in your editor and add:

  ```ts filename="transaction.ts"
  import {
    Account,
    Aptos,
    AptosConfig,
    Network,
  } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";

  async function main() {
    // Initialize the Aptos client
    const config = new AptosConfig({ network: Network.DEVNET });
    const aptos = new Aptos(config);
    
    console.log("Connected to Aptos devnet");
    
    // More code will go here
  }

  main().catch(console.error);
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
  We're connecting to the Aptos devnet, which is a test network where you can experiment without using real coins. The devnet is reset periodically, so don't store anything important there. You can explore the full TypeScript SDK source code in the [aptos-ts-sdk repository](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-ts-sdk).
  </Callout>

  ### Generate accounts

  Add this code inside your `main()` function to create two accounts - Alice (sender) and Bob (receiver):

  ```ts filename="transaction.ts"
  // Generate two accounts
  const alice = Account.generate();
  const bob = Account.generate();

  console.log("=== Addresses ===");
  console.log(`Alice's address: ${alice.accountAddress}`);
  console.log(`Bob's address: ${bob.accountAddress}`);
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
  Each account has a unique address (like a bank account number) and a keypair (like your login credentials). The address is derived from the public key, while the private key is kept secret and used for signing transactions. For more details on how accounts work in Aptos, see [Account basics](../../network/blockchain/accounts).
  </Callout>

  ### Fund the accounts

  Add this code after generating the accounts to get test coins from the faucet:

  ```ts filename="transaction.ts"
  // Fund the accounts with test APT from the devnet faucet
  console.log("\n=== Funding accounts ===");
  await aptos.fundAccount({
    accountAddress: alice.accountAddress,
    amount: 100_000_000, // 1 APT = 100,000,000 octas
  });
  await aptos.fundAccount({
    accountAddress: bob.accountAddress,
    amount: 0, // Bob starts with 0 APT
  });
  console.log("Accounts funded successfully");

  // Check initial balances
  const aliceBalance = await aptos.getAccountAPTAmount({
    accountAddress: alice.accountAddress,
  });
  const bobBalance = await aptos.getAccountAPTAmount({
    accountAddress: bob.accountAddress,
  });

  console.log("\n=== Initial Balances ===");
  console.log(`Alice: ${aliceBalance} octas`);
  console.log(`Bob: ${bobBalance} octas`);
  ```

  ### Run the code

  Let's test our code so far:

  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  npx ts-node transaction.ts
  ```

  You should see output similar to:

  ```
  Connected to Aptos devnet
  === Addresses ===
  Alice's address: 0x978c213990c4833df71548df7ce49d54c759d6b6d932de22b24d56060b7af2aa
  Bob's address: 0x7af2d6c93a2feafc9b69b5e8ad9d6b513b260f62f23f3a384a3a2e4a84694a9b

  === Funding accounts ===
  Accounts funded successfully

  === Initial Balances ===
  Alice: 100000000 octas
  Bob: 0 octas

  alice_amount = 100_000_000  # 1 APT = 100,000,000 octas
  bob_amount = 0  # Bob starts with 0 APT

  await faucet_client.fund_account(alice.address(), alice_amount)
  await faucet_client.fund_account(bob.address(), bob_amount)
  print("Accounts funded successfully")

  # Check initial balances
  alice_balance = await rest_client.account_balance(alice.address())
  bob_balance = await rest_client.account_balance(bob.address())

## 3. Building a Transaction

<Tabs items={["TypeScript", "Python"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

  Now that we have funded accounts, let's create a transaction to transfer coins from Alice to Bob. This is like filling out a form specifying what you want to send and to whom.

  <Steps>

  ### Understand transaction structure

  A transaction in Aptos has several key components:

  1. **Sender**: The account initiating the transaction (Alice)
  2. **Function**: The on-chain function to call (in this case, a coin transfer)
  3. **Arguments**: Data needed by the function (recipient address and amount)
  4. **Gas parameters**: Maximum gas amount and gas unit price
  5. **Expiration time**: When the transaction is no longer valid if not executed
  6. **Sequence number**: A counter that prevents replay attacks

  <Callout type="info">
  All data in Aptos transactions is serialized using Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS), a compact and deterministic format designed for blockchain use. The SDK handles this serialization for you.

  BCS ensures that transaction data is consistently encoded across different platforms and languages, which is critical for a blockchain where the same transaction might be processed by nodes running different implementations.
  </Callout>

  ### Build the transaction

  Let's add code to build a transaction that transfers 1000 octas from Alice to Bob:

  Add this code to your `main()` function:

  ```ts filename="transaction.ts"
  // 1. Build the transaction
  console.log("\n=== 1. Building the transaction ===");
  const transaction = await aptos.transaction.build.simple({
    sender: alice.accountAddress,
    data: {
      function: "0x1::aptos_account::transfer",
      functionArguments: [bob.accountAddress, 1000], // Transfer 1000 octas
    },
  });
  console.log("Transaction built successfully");

  // Access transaction details from the raw transaction
  const rawTxn = transaction.rawTransaction;
  console.log(`Sender: ${rawTxn.sender}`);
  console.log(`Sequence Number: ${rawTxn.sequence_number}`);
  console.log(`Max Gas Amount: ${rawTxn.max_gas_amount}`);
  console.log(`Gas Unit Price: ${rawTxn.gas_unit_price}`);
  console.log(`Expiration Timestamp: ${new Date(Number(rawTxn.expiration_timestamp_secs) * 1000).toISOString()}`);
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
  The function `0x1::aptos_account::transfer` is a built-in function in the Aptos framework that transfers coins between accounts. The `0x1` prefix indicates it's part of the core framework. Behind the scenes, this function calls the [Coin Move module source code](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/coin.move) to perform the actual transfer.

  ```python filename="transaction.py"
  # 1. Build the transaction
  print("\n=== 1. Building the transaction ===")

  # Create the entry function payload
  # This specifies which function to call and with what arguments
  entry_function = EntryFunction.natural(
      "0x1::aptos_account",  # Module address and name
      "transfer",            # Function name
      [],                    # Type arguments (empty for this function)
      [
          # Function arguments with their serialization type
          TransactionArgument(bob.address(), Serializer.struct),  # Recipient address
          TransactionArgument(1000, Serializer.u64),              # Amount to transfer (1000 octas)
      ],
  )

  # Get the chain ID for the transaction
  chain_id = await rest_client.chain_id()

  # Get the sender's current sequence number
  account_data = await rest_client.account(alice.address())
  sequence_number = int(account_data["sequence_number"])

  # Create the raw transaction with all required fields
  raw_transaction = RawTransaction(
      sender=alice.address(),                                    # Sender's address
      sequence_number=sequence_number,                           # Sequence number to prevent replay attacks
      payload=TransactionPayload(entry_function),                # The function to call
      max_gas_amount=2000,                                       # Maximum gas units to use
      gas_unit_price=100,                                        # Price per gas unit in octas
      expiration_timestamps_secs=int(time.time()) + 600,         # Expires in 10 minutes
      chain_id=chain_id,                                         # Chain ID to ensure correct network
  )

  print("Transaction built successfully")
  print(f"Sender: {raw_transaction.sender}")
  print(f"Sequence Number: {raw_transaction.sequence_number}")
  print(f"Max Gas Amount: {raw_transaction.max_gas_amount}")
  print(f"Gas Unit Price: {raw_transaction.gas_unit_price}")
  print(f"Expiration Timestamp: {time.ctime(raw_transaction.expiration_timestamps_secs)}")

  The Python SDK uses several key components to construct transactions:
  - `EntryFunction.natural()` creates a callable Move function reference
  - `TransactionArgument` with `Serializer` types ensures proper BCS serialization
  - `TransactionPayload` wraps the entry function for inclusion in the transaction
  - `RawTransaction` combines all transaction parameters into a complete transaction

  This layered approach gives you fine-grained control over transaction construction.

## 4. Simulating the Transaction

<Tabs items={["TypeScript", "Python"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

  Before submitting a transaction, it's wise to simulate it first to estimate the gas cost. This is like checking shipping costs before sending a package.

  <Steps>

  ### Simulate the transaction

  Add this code after building the transaction:

  ```ts filename="transaction.ts"
  // 2. Simulate the transaction
  console.log("\n=== 2. Simulating the transaction ===");
  const [simulationResult] = await aptos.transaction.simulate.simple({
    signerPublicKey: alice.publicKey,
    transaction,
  });

  const gasUsed = parseInt(simulationResult.gas_used);
  const gasUnitPrice = parseInt(simulationResult.gas_unit_price);
  console.log(`Estimated gas units: ${gasUsed}`);
  console.log(`Estimated gas cost: ${gasUsed * gasUnitPrice} octas`);
  console.log(`Transaction would ${simulationResult.success ? "succeed" : "fail"}`);
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
  Gas is the computational fee paid to process transactions on the blockchain. The total cost is calculated as `gas_used × gas_unit_price`. During simulation, the blockchain executes the transaction in a temporary environment to estimate these costs without making permanent changes to the blockchain state. This helps you avoid failed transactions due to insufficient gas.

  # Create a BCS transaction for simulation
  # This doesn't actually submit the transaction to the blockchain
  simulation_transaction = await rest_client.create_bcs_transaction(alice, TransactionPayload(entry_function))

  # Simulate the transaction to estimate gas costs and check for errors
  simulation_result = await rest_client.simulate_transaction(simulation_transaction, alice)

  # Extract and display the simulation results
  gas_used = int(simulation_result[0]['gas_used'])
  gas_unit_price = int(simulation_result[0]['gas_unit_price'])
  success = simulation_result[0]['success']

  print(f"Estimated gas units: {gas_used}")
  print(f"Estimated gas cost: {gas_used * gas_unit_price} octas")
  print(f"Transaction would {'succeed' if success else 'fail'}")

## 5. Signing and Submitting the Transaction

<Tabs items={["TypeScript", "Python"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

  Now that we've built and simulated the transaction, we need to sign it with Alice's private key and submit it to the blockchain.

  <Steps>

  ### Sign the transaction

  Signing proves that Alice authorized this transaction:

  Add this code after simulating the transaction:

  ```ts filename="transaction.ts"
  // 3. Sign the transaction
  console.log("\n=== 3. Signing the transaction ===");
  const senderAuthenticator = aptos.transaction.sign({
    signer: alice,
    transaction,
  });
  console.log("Transaction signed successfully");
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
  Digital signatures work like a personal seal or signature in the physical world. They prove that the transaction was authorized by the account owner (who has the private key) and haven't been tampered with.
  </Callout>

  ### Submit the transaction

  Add this code after signing the transaction to submit the signed transaction to the blockchain:

  ```ts filename="transaction.ts"
  // 4. Submit the transaction
  console.log("\n=== 4. Submitting the transaction ===");
  const pendingTransaction = await aptos.transaction.submit.simple({
    transaction,
    senderAuthenticator,
  });
  console.log(`Transaction submitted with hash: ${pendingTransaction.hash}`);
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
  The transaction hash is a unique identifier for your transaction, similar to a tracking number for a package. When submitting a transaction, the Aptos blockchain performs several validation checks, including verifying the transaction signature and ensuring the sequence number hasn't been used before (preventing replay attacks). You can use the hash to check the status of your transaction on the [Aptos Explorer](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/) or via the [REST API](../apis/fullnode-rest-api-reference).

      alice,                           # Account with the private key
      TransactionPayload(entry_function),  # The payload from our transaction
      sequence_number=sequence_number  # Use the same sequence number as before
  )

## 6. Waiting for Confirmation

<Tabs items={["TypeScript", "Python"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

  After submitting a transaction, we need to wait for it to be processed by the blockchain. This is like waiting for a package to be delivered.

  <Steps>

  ### Wait for transaction completion

  Add this code after submitting the transaction:

  ```ts filename="transaction.ts"
  // 5. Wait for the transaction to complete
  console.log("\n=== 5. Waiting for transaction completion ===");
  const txnResult = await aptos.waitForTransaction({
    transactionHash: pendingTransaction.hash,
  });
  console.log(`Transaction completed with status: ${txnResult.success ? "SUCCESS" : "FAILURE"}`);

  // If you want to see more details about the transaction:
  console.log(`VM Status: ${txnResult.vm_status}`);
  console.log(`Gas used: ${txnResult.gas_used}`);
  ```

  ### Verify the results

  Add this code after waiting for the transaction to check the balances and confirm the transfer worked:

  ```ts filename="transaction.ts"
  // Check final balances
  const aliceFinalBalance = await aptos.getAccountAPTAmount({
    accountAddress: alice.accountAddress,
  });
  const bobFinalBalance = await aptos.getAccountAPTAmount({
    accountAddress: bob.accountAddress,
  });

  console.log("\n=== Final Balances ===");
  console.log(`Alice: ${aliceFinalBalance} octas (spent ${aliceBalance - aliceFinalBalance} octas on transfer and gas)`);
  console.log(`Bob: ${bobFinalBalance} octas (received 1000 octas)`);
  ```

  ### Run the complete code

  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  npx ts-node transaction.ts
  ```

  You should see output similar to:

  Notice that Alice's balance decreased by more than 1000 octas. The extra amount is the gas fee paid to process the transaction. Behind the scenes, when checking balances, the SDK queries the CoinStore resource for the AptosCoin (`0x1::coin::CoinStore<0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin>`) and reads the current stored value. This demonstrates how the SDK abstracts away complex blockchain interactions into simple function calls.

  After submitting a transaction, we need to wait for it to be processed by the blockchain. This is like waiting for a package to be delivered.

  <Steps>

  ### Wait for transaction completion

  Add this code after submitting the transaction:

  ```python filename="transaction.py"
  # 5. Wait for the transaction to complete
  print("\n=== 5. Waiting for transaction completion ===")

  # Wait for the transaction to be processed by the blockchain
  # This polls the blockchain until the transaction is confirmed
  await rest_client.wait_for_transaction(tx_hash)

  # Get the transaction details to check its status
  transaction_details = await rest_client.transaction_by_hash(tx_hash)
  success = transaction_details["success"]
  vm_status = transaction_details["vm_status"]
  gas_used = transaction_details["gas_used"]

  print(f"Transaction completed with status: {'SUCCESS' if success else 'FAILURE'}")
  print(f"VM Status: {vm_status}")
  print(f"Gas used: {gas_used}")
  ```

  ### Verify the results

  Add this code after waiting for the transaction to check the balances and confirm the transfer worked:

  ```python filename="transaction.py"
  # Check final balances
  alice_final_balance = await rest_client.account_balance(alice.address())
  bob_final_balance = await rest_client.account_balance(bob.address())

  print("\n=== Final Balances ===")
  print(f"Alice: {alice_final_balance} octas (spent {alice_balance - alice_final_balance} octas on transfer and gas)")
  print(f"Bob: {bob_final_balance} octas (received 1000 octas)")
  ```

  ### Run the complete code

  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  python transaction.py
  ```

  You should see output similar to:

  ```

## 7. (Optional) Explore Your Transaction On-Chain

Now that you've successfully executed a transaction, you can explore it on the Aptos Explorer. This will help you understand how transactions are recorded on the blockchain and what information is publicly available.

<Steps>

### Copy your transaction hash

From your terminal output, copy the transaction hash that was printed after submission. It looks something like this:

```
Transaction submitted with hash: 0x3a8a3e34a1c64ad9d7636a3a827b7ec3bb12d73825b36fa06d425c5a3b42cccc
```

### Open the Aptos Explorer

Go to the [Aptos Explorer](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/?network=devnet).

### Ensure you are on `Devnet` network

Look for "Devnet" in the top right corner, or switch networks by clicking the dropdown and selecting Devnet.

![Switching to Devnet network in Aptos Explorer](/screenshots/explorer_devnet.png)

### Search for your transaction

Paste your transaction hash into the search bar in the middle of the page.

<Callout type="warning">
Do not press enter! There is a known bug where searching with Enter does not work.
</Callout>

### View the transaction details

Wait for the results to appear, then click on the transaction hash to view its details.

You should see information about your transaction, including:
- Status (should be "Success")
- Timestamp
- Gas used
- Sender and recipient addresses
- Amount transferred

### Explore further

From the transaction details page, you can:
- Click on the sender or recipient addresses to view their account details
- See the exact changes made to the blockchain state
- View the transaction payload and arguments

<Callout type="info">
The Explorer is a powerful tool for debugging transactions and understanding blockchain activity. Developers frequently use it to verify their transactions executed as expected and to investigate any issues.
</Callout>
</Steps>

## 8. Next Steps

  Congratulations! You've successfully created and executed your first transaction on the Aptos blockchain. Here are some suggestions for what to explore next:

  **Learn about more complex transactions**:
    - [Multi-Agent Signatures](../sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions/multi-agent-transactions) - Transactions requiring multiple signers
    - [Sponsoring Transactions](../sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions/sponsoring-transactions) - Having another account pay gas fees
    - [Batching Transactions](../sdks/ts-sdk/building-transactions/batching-transactions) - Sending multiple transactions efficiently

  <Callout type="info">
  The above links are for the Typescript SDK but the principles are the same if you are using Python or Rust.
