# Build an End-to-End Dapp on Aptos

A common way to learn a new framework or programming language is to build a simple todo list. In this tutorial, we will learn how to build an end-to-end todo list dapp, starting from the smart contract side through the front-end side and finally use of a wallet to interact with the two.

See the completed code in the [source-code](https://github.com/aptos-labs/developer-docs/tree/main/apps/nextra/pages/en/build/guides/build-e2e-dapp).

## Chapters

After meeting the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and [getting set up](#setup) as described below, you will follow this tutorial in this order:

1. [Create a smart contract](build-e2e-dapp/1-create-smart-contract.mdx)
2. [Set up a frontend](build-e2e-dapp/2-set-up-the-frontend.mdx)
3. [Fetch Data from Chain](build-e2e-dapp/3-fetch-data-from-chain.mdx)
4. [Submit data to chain](build-e2e-dapp/4-submit-data-to-chain.mdx)
5. [Handle Tasks](build-e2e-dapp/5-handle-tasks.mdx)

## Prerequisites

You must have:

- [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Although we will explain some React decisions, we are not going to deep dive into how React works; so we assume you have some previous experience with React.

## Setup

In this section, we will create a `my-first-dapp` directory to hold our project files, both client-side code (React based) and the Move code (our smart contract).

For that, we will be using [create-aptos-dapp](../create-aptos-dapp.mdx) to create the project.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the desired directory for the project (for example, the `Desktop` directory).
2. Run `npx create-aptos-dapp@latest` to create the project.

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-aptos-dapp@latest
```

3. Follow the instructions to create the project.
- Choose a name for the project, for example `my-first-dapp`.
- Choose the `Full-stack project` option.
- Choose the `Boilerplate Template` option.
- For simplicity, choose not to use Surf.
- Choose the `Vite app` framework option.
- Choose the `Devnet` network option.

The tool will create the project in a directory with the same name as the project and install the required dependencies.

Follow the `Next Steps` instructions.

Now let's [create a smart contract](build-e2e-dapp/1-create-smart-contract.mdx).
