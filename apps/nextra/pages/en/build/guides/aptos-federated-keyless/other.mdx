## Frequently Asked Questions

**What if I stop using my IAM for my application? What if I switch IAM providers?**

- An account address depends on values of several variables that are specific to an IAM service, including `aud` (client ID) and `iss` (issuer).  If these values are changed, then a different address will be derived. 
- If you want to switch IAM providers, you will need to develop an account migration flow, resulting in a key rotation from the account derived from the prior IAM provider to the account derived from the new IAM provider. 
- We recommend allowing your users to add a secondary authentication method to their accounts (e.g. back-up private key) so that they can maintain access should the authentication path into their account via Federated Keyless is disrupted via service provider change

**How do I make sure my users can continue accessing their accounts?**

- We recommend allowing your users to add a secondary authentication method to their accounts (e.g. back-up private key) so that they can maintain access should the authentication path into their account via Federated Keyless is disrupted via service provider change or other 
 (In some future I would love to be able to tell users that email backup is possible)

**What differences in legal considerations between standard keyless and federated keyless?**

- Custody - Admin has the ability to impersonate a user.
