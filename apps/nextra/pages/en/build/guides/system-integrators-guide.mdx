# Integrate with the Aptos Blockchain

If you provide blockchain services to your customers and wish to add the Aptos
blockchain to your platform, then this guide is for you. This system integrators
guide will walk you through all you need to integrate the Aptos blockchain into
your platform.

## Overview

This document will guide you through the following tasks to integrate with
Aptos:

1. Prepare an environment for testing.
2. Create an account on the blockchain.
3. Exchange account identifiers with another entity on the blockchain, for
example, to perform swaps.
4. Create a transaction.
5. Obtain a gas estimate and validate the transaction for correctness.
6. Submit the transaction to the blockchain.
7. Wait for the outcome of the transaction.
8. Query historical transactions and interactions for a given account with a
specific account, i.e., withdraws and deposits.

## Getting Started

In order to get started you'll need to select a network and pick your set of
tools. There are also a handful of SDKs to help accelerate development.

### Choose a network

There are four well-supported networks for integrating with the Aptos
blockchain:

1. [Localnet](http://127.0.0.1:8080) -- our standalone tool for local
development against a known version of the codebase with no external network.
2. [Devnet](https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/) -- a shared resource for
the community, data resets weekly, weekly update from aptos-core main branch.
3. [Testnet](https://api.testnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/) -- a shared resource
for the community, data will be preserved, network configuration will mimic
Mainnet.
4. [Mainnet](https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/) -- a production
network with real assets.

See [Aptos Blockchain Networks](../../network/nodes/networks.mdx) for full details on each
environment.

### Run a localnet

There are two options for running a localnet:

- [Install the Aptos CLI](../cli.mdx) and 2) run
a [local development network](../cli/running-a-local-network.mdx).
This path is useful for developing on the Aptos blockchain, debugging Move
contracts, and testing node operations. This will provide a fully featured
local development environment including a single node network, a node REST
API, an Indexer API, and a faucet.
- Directly [run a localnet](../../network/nodes/localnet/run-a-localnet.mdx) using either
the [Aptos-core source code](../../network/nodes/localnet/run-a-localnet.mdx).
These paths are useful for testing changes to the Aptos-core codebase or
framework, or for building services on top of the Aptos blockchain,
respectively.

Either of these methods will expose
a [REST API service](../apis/fullnode-rest-api.mdx) at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
and a Faucet API service at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` for option 1 run a localnet
or `http://127.0.0.1:8081` for option 2 install the Aptos CLI. The applications
will output the location of the services.

### SDKs and tools

Aptos currently provides four SDKs:

1. [Typescript](../sdks/ts-sdk.mdx)
2. [Python](../sdks/python-sdk.mdx)
3. [Rust](../sdks/rust-sdk.mdx)
4. [Unity](../sdks/unity-sdk.mdx)
5. [Go SDK](../sdks/go-sdk.mdx)

Almost all developers will benefit from exploring the CLI.
[Using the CLI](../cli.mdx) demonstrates how the CLI can be used to create
accounts, transfer coins, publish Move modules, and more.

## Accounts on Aptos

An [account](../../network/blockchain/accounts.mdx) represents
an entity on the Aptos blockchain that can send transactions. Each account is
identified by a particular 32-byte account address and is a container for
[Move modules and resources](../../network/blockchain/resources.mdx).
On Aptos, accounts must be created on-chain prior to any blockchain operations
involving that account. The Aptos framework supports implicitly creating
accounts when transferring Aptos coin via [`aptos_account::transfer`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/88c9aab3982c246f8aa75eb2caf8c8ab1dcab491/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/aptos_account.move#L18)
or explicitly via [`aptos_account::create_account`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/88c9aab3982c246f8aa75eb2caf8c8ab1dcab491/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/aptos_account.move#L13).

At creation, an [Aptos account](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/88c9aab3982c246f8aa75eb2caf8c8ab1dcab491/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/account.move#L23) contains:

- A [resource containing Aptos Coin](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/60751b5ed44984178c7163933da3d1b18ad80388/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/coin.move#L50)
and deposit and withdrawal of coins from that resource.
- An authentication key associated with their current public, private key(s).
- A strictly
increasing [sequence number](../../network/blockchain/accounts.mdx)
that represents the account's next transaction's sequence number to prevent
replay attacks.
- A strictly increasing number that represents the next distinct GUID creation
number.
- An [event handle](../../network/blockchain/events.mdx) for all new types of coins added to
the account.
- An event handle for all key rotations for the account.

Read more about [Accounts](../../network/blockchain/accounts.mdx)
and [set one up](../cli/setup-cli.mdx).

## Transactions

Aptos [transactions](../../network/blockchain/txns-states.mdx) are encoded
in [Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS)](https://github.com/diem/bcs).
Transactions contain information such as the sender’s account address,
authentication from the sender, the desired operation to be performed on the
Aptos blockchain, and the amount of gas the sender is willing to pay to execute
the transaction.

Read more in [Transactions and States](../../network/blockchain/txns-states.mdx).

### Generating transactions

Aptos supports two methods for constructing transactions:

- Using the Aptos client libraries to generate native BCS transactions.
- Constructing JSON-encoded objects and interacting with the REST API to
generate native transactions.

The preferred approach is to directly generate native BCS transactions.
Generating them via the REST API enables rapid development at the cost of
trusting the fullnode to generate the transaction correctly.

#### BCS-encoded transactions

BCS-encoded transactions can be submitted to the `/transactions` endpoint but
must specify `Content-Type: application/x.aptos.signed_transaction+bcs` in the
HTTP headers. This will return a transaction submission result that, if
successful, contains a transaction hash in
the `hash` [field](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/9b85d41ed8ef4a61a9cd64f9de511654fcc02024/ecosystem/python/sdk/aptos_sdk/client.py#L138).

#### JSON-encoded transactions

JSON-encoded transactions can be generated via
the [REST API](https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/), following these
steps:

1. First construct an appropriate JSON payload for
the `/transactions/encode_submission` endpoint as demonstrated in
the [Python SDK](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/b0fe7ea6687e9c180ebdbac8d8eb984d11d7e4d4/ecosystem/python/sdk/aptos_sdk/client.py#L128).
2. The output of the above contains an object containing a `message` that must
be signed with the sender’s private key locally.
3. Extend the original JSON payload with the signature information and post it
to
the `/transactions` [endpoint](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/b0fe7ea6687e9c180ebdbac8d8eb984d11d7e4d4/ecosystem/python/sdk/aptos_sdk/client.py#L142).
This will return a transaction submission result that, if successful,
contains a transaction hash in
the `hash` [field](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/b0fe7ea6687e9c180ebdbac8d8eb984d11d7e4d4/ecosystem/python/sdk/aptos_sdk/client.py#L145).

JSON-encoded transactions allow for rapid development and support seamless ABI
conversions of transaction arguments to native types. However, most system
integrators prefer to generate transactions within their own tech stack. Both
the [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/9b85d41ed8ef4a61a9cd64f9de511654fcc02024/ecosystem/typescript/sdk/src/aptos_client.ts#L259)
and [Python SDK](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/b0fe7ea6687e9c180ebdbac8d8eb984d11d7e4d4/ecosystem/python/sdk/aptos_sdk/client.py#L100)
support generating BCS transactions.

### Types of transactions

Within a given transaction, the target of execution can be one of two types:

- An entry point (formerly known as script function)
- A script (payload)

Both [Python](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/3973311dac6bb9348bfc81cf983c2a1be11f1b48/ecosystem/python/sdk/aptos_sdk/client.py#L256)
and [TypeScript](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/3973311dac6bb9348bfc81cf983c2a1be11f1b48/ecosystem/typescript/sdk/src/aptos_client.test.ts#L93)
support the generation of transactions that target entry points. This guide
points out many of those entry points, such as `aptos_account::transfer`
and `aptos_account::create_account`.

Most basic operations on the Aptos blockchain should be available via entry
point calls. While one could submit multiple transactions calling entry points
in series, such operations benefit from being called atomically from a single
transaction. A script payload transaction can call any public (entry) function
defined within any module. Here's an
example [Move script](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/main/aptos-move/move-examples/scripts/two_by_two_transfer)
that uses a MultiAgent transaction to extract funds from two accounts and
deposit them into two other accounts. This is
a [Python example](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/ecosystem/python/sdk/examples/transfer_two_by_two.py)
that uses the bytecode generated by compiling that script. Currently, there is
limited support for script payloads in TypeScript.

### Status of a transaction

Obtain transaction status by querying the
API [`/transactions/by_hash/{hash}`](https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/operations/get_transaction_by_hash)
with the hash returned during the submission of the transaction.

A reasonable strategy for submitting transactions is to limit their lifetime to
30 to 60 seconds, and polling that API at regular intervals until success or
several seconds after that time has elapsed. If there is no commitment on-chain,
the transaction was likely discarded.

### Testing transactions or transaction pre-execution

To facilitate evaluation of transactions as well as gas estimation, Aptos
supports a simulation API that does not require and should not contain valid
signatures on transactions.

The simulation API is a synchronous API that executes a transaction and returns
the output inclusive of gas usage. The simulation API can be accessed by
submitting a transaction
to [`/transactions/simulate`](https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/operations/simulate_transaction).

Both
the [Typescript SDK](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-ts-sdk/blob/main/src/api/transactionSubmission/simulate.ts)
and [Python SDK](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/ecosystem/python/sdk/examples/simulate_transfer_coin.py)
support the simulation API. Note the output and gas used may change based upon
the state of the account. For gas estimations, we recommend that the maximum gas
amount be larger than the amount quoted by this API.

## Viewing current and historical state

Most integrations into the Aptos blockchain benefit from a holistic and
comprehensive overview of the current and historical state of the blockchain.
Aptos provides historical transactions, state, and events, all the result of
transaction execution.

- Historical transactions specify the execution status, output, and tie to
related events. Each transaction has a unique version number associated with
it that dictates its global sequential ordering in the history of the
blockchain ledger.
- The state is the representation of all transaction outputs up to a specific
version. In other words, a state version is the accumulation of all
transactions inclusive of that transaction version.
- As transactions execute, they may emit events. [Events](../../network/blockchain/events.mdx)
are hints about changes in on-chain data.

The storage service on a node employs two forms of pruning that erase data from
nodes:

- state
- events, transactions, and everything else

While either of these may be disabled, storing the state versions is not
particularly sustainable.

Events and transactions pruning can be disabled via setting
the [`enable_ledger_pruner`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/cf0bc2e4031a843cdc0c04e70b3f7cd92666afcf/config/src/config/storage_config.rs#L141)
to `false`. This is default behavior in Mainnet. In the near future, Aptos will
provide indexers that mitigate the need to directly query from a node.

The REST API offers querying transactions and events in these ways:

- [Transactions for an account](https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/operations/get_account_transactions)
- [Transaction by version](https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/operations/get_transaction_by_version)
- [Events by event handle](https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/operations/get_events_by_event_handle)

## Exchanging and tracking fungible assets

Aptos has a
standard [Fungible Asset](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/fungible_asset.move).
Different types of fungible asset (FA) can be represented in this standard
through the use of distinct metadata object.

A user's FA is stored in `FungibleStore` objects owned by them. For each type of
FA, every account has one primary store for that FA and
optional multiple secondary stores. The difference between primary and secondary
stores is the address of primary store
is deterministic based on the addresses of user account and metadata object.

### Transferring FAs between users

FAs, including APT, can be transferred between users' primary stores via
the [`primary_fungible_store::transfer`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/primary_fungible_store.move#L142)
function.
For any `FungibleStore`
s, [`fungible_asset::transfer`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/fungible_asset.move#L347)
would be invoked with `FungibleStore` object addresses.

### Current balance for Fungible Asset

The current balance for an APT FA of FungibleStore is available at the account resources URL: `https://{rest_api_server}/accounts/{fungible_store_object_address}/resource/0x1::fungible_asset::FungibleStore`. The balance is stored as `balance`. The resource also contains a metadata object of the FA type and the frozen status. The address of the primary fungible store can be calculated as `sha3_256(32-byte account address | 32-byte metadata object address | 0xFC)`. The metadata object address of APT FA is `0xA`.

Aptos users have the option to upgrade to concurrent fungible balance to allow parallelization of balance updates, improving the performance of a single account. When a user has upgraded a fungible store balance to support concurrent update, the fungible store object will have another resource `ConcurrentFungibleBalance` that contains the balance of the store, and the `balance` field of FungibleStore will be set to 0. The current balance for an APT FA of `ConcurrentFungibleBalance` (if exists) is available at the account resources URL: `https://{rest_api_server}/accounts/{fungible_store_object_address}/resource/0x1::fungible_asset::ConcurrentFungibleBalance`.

Therefore, to get the total balance of a fungible asset, it is either the non-zero balance of `FungibleStore` or the `balance` field of `ConcurrentFungibleBalance` if it exists and the balance of `FungibleStore` is 0.

```json
{
  "type": "0x1::fungible_asset::FungibleStore",
  "data": {
    "balance": "233910778869",
    "frozen": false,
    "metadata": {
      "inner": "0xedc2704f2cef417a06d1756a04a16a9fa6faaed13af469be9cdfcac5a21a8e2e"
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
    "type": "0x1::fungible_asset::ConcurrentFungibleBalance",
    "data": {
        "balance": "233910778869"
    }
}
```

## Exchanging and tracking coins

Aptos has a standard
[Coin type](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/coin.move).
Different types of coins can be represented in this type through the use of
distinct structs that represent the type parameter or generic for `Coin<T>`.

Coins are stored within an account under the resource `CoinStore<T>`. At account
creation, each user has the resource `CoinStore<0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin>`
or `CoinStore<AptosCoin>`, for short. Within this resource is the Aptos
coin: `Coin<AptosCoin>`.

### Transferring coins between users

Coins, including APT, can be transferred between users via
the [`aptos_account::transfer_coins`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/d1610e1bb5214689a37a9cab59cf9254e8eb2be1/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/aptos_account.move#L92)
function for all coins
and [`aptos_account::transfer`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/88c9aab3982c246f8aa75eb2caf8c8ab1dcab491/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/aptos_account.move#L18)
for Aptos coins.

<Callout type="warning">
  It is important to note that if an account has not registered a `CoinStore<T>`
  for a given `T`, then any transfer of type `T` to that account will fail.
</Callout>

### Current balance for a coin
The current balance for a `Coin<T>` where `T` is the Aptos coin is available at
the account resources URL:
  ```
  https://{rest_api_server}/accounts/{address}/resource/0x1::coin::CoinStore<0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin>
  ```
  The balance is stored within `coin::amount`. The resource also contains the
  total number of deposit and withdraw events, and the `counter` value
  within `deposit_events` and `withdraw_events`, respectively.

  ```json
  {
    "type": "0x1::coin::CoinStore<0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin>",
    "data": {
      "coin": {
        "value": "3927"
      },
      "deposit_events": {
        "counter": "1",
        "guid": {
          "id": {
            "addr": "0xcb2f940705c44ba110cd3b4f6540c96f2634938bd5f2aabd6946abf12ed88457",
            "creation_num": "2"
          }
        }
      },
      "withdraw_events": {
        "counter": "1",
        "guid": {
          "id": {
            "addr": "0xcb2f940705c44ba110cd3b4f6540c96f2634938bd5f2aabd6946abf12ed88457",
            "creation_num": "3"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  ### Querying transactions

  In Aptos, each transaction is committed as a distinct version to the
  blockchain. This allows for the convenience of sharing committed transactions
  by their version number; to do so, query:
  `https://{rest_server_api}/transactions/by_version/{version}`

  Transactions submitted by an account can also be queried via the following URL
  where the `sequence_number` matches the sequence number of the transaction:
  `https://{rest_server_api}/account/{address}/transactions?start={sequence_number}&limit=1`

  A transfer transaction would appear as follows:

  ```json
  {
    "version": "13629679",
    "gas_used": "4",
    "success": true,
    "vm_status": "Executed successfully",
    "changes": [
      {

  ```

  Here is a breakdown of the information in a transaction:

  - `version` indicates the globally unique identifier for this transaction, its
  ordered position in all the committed transactions on the blockchain
  - `sender` is the account address of the entity that submitted the transaction
  - `gas_used` is the units paid for executing the transaction
  - `success` and `vm_status` indicate whether the transaction successfully
  executed and any reasons why it might not have
  - `changes` include the final values for any state resources that have been
  modified during the execution of the transaction
  - `events` contain all the events emitted during the transaction execution
  - `timestamp` is the near real-time timestamp of the transaction's execution

  If `success` is false, then `vm_status` will contain an error code or message
  that resulted in the transaction failing to succeed. When `success` is
  false, `changes` will be limited to gas deducted from the account and the
  sequence number incrementing. There will be no `events`.

  Each event in `events` is differentiated by a `key`. The `key` is derived from
  the `guid` in `changes`. Specifically, the `key` is a 40-byte hex string where
  the first eight bytes (or 16 characters) are the little-endian representation
  of the `creation_num` in the `guid` of the `changes` event, and the remaining
  characters are the account address.

  As events do not dictate what emitted them, it is imperative to track the path
  in `changes` to determine the source of an event. In particular,
  each `CoinStore<T>` has both a `WithdrawEvent` and a `DepositEvent`, based
  upon the type of coin. In order to determine which coin type is used in a
  transaction, an indexer can compare the `guid::creation_num` in a `changes`
  event combined with the address to the `key` for events in `events`.

  Using the above example, `events[1].guid` is equivalent
  to `changes[0].data.data.deposit_events.guid`, which
  is
  ```json
  {"addr": "0x5098df8e7969b58ab3bd2d440c6203f64c60a1fd5c08b9d4abe6ae4216246c3e", "creation_num": "2"}
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
    The `key` field will be going away in favor of `guid`
  </Callout>

  ### Querying events

  Aptos provides clear and canonical events for all withdraw and deposit of
  coins. This can be used in coordination with the associated transactions to
  present to a user the change of their account balance over time, when that
  happened, and what caused it. With some amount of additional parsing, metadata
  such as the transaction type and the other parties involved can also be shared.

  Query events by handle
  URL: `https://{rest_api_server}/accounts/{address}/events/0x1::coin::CoinStore<0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin>/withdraw_events`
  ```json
  [
    {
      "version":"13629679",
      "key": "0x0300000000000000cb2f940705c44ba110cd3b4f6540c96f2634938bd5f2aabd6946abf12ed88457",
      "guid": {
        "id": {
          "addr": "0x810026ca8291dd88b5b30a1d3ca2edd683d33d06c4a7f7c451d96f6d47bc5e8b",
          "creation_num": "3"
        }
      },
      "sequence_number": "0",
      "type": "0x1::coin::WithdrawEvent",
      "data": {
        "amount": "1000"
      }
    }
  ]
  ```

  Gather more information from the transaction that generated the event by
  querying `https://{rest_server_api}/transactions/by_version/{version}`
  where `{version}` is the same value as the `{version}` in the event query.

  <Callout type="info">
    When tracking full movement of coins, normally events are
    sufficient. `0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin`, however, requires
    considering `gas_used` for each transaction sent from the given account
    since it represents gas in Aptos. To reduce unnecessary overhead, extracting
    gas fees due to transactions does not emit an event. All transactions for an
    account can be retrieved from this API:
    `https://{rest_server_api}/accounts/{address}/transactions`
  </Callout>

  ### Tracking coin balance changes

  Consider the transaction from the earlier section, but now with an arbitrary
  coin `0x1337::my_coin::MyCoin` and some gas parameters changed:

  }
  ```

  There are three balance changes in this transaction:

  1. A withdrawal of `1000` of `0x1337::my_coin::MyCoin` from the transaction
  sending account `0x810026ca8291dd88b5b30a1d3ca2edd683d33d06c4a7f7c451d96f6d47bc5e8b`
  2. A deposit of `1000` of `0x1337::my_coin::MyCoin` to receiving account `0x5098df8e7969b58ab3bd2d440c6203f64c60a1fd5c08b9d4abe6ae4216246c3e`
  3. A gas fee `2200` of `0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin` from the sending account `0x810026ca8291dd88b5b30a1d3ca2edd683d33d06c4a7f7c451d96f6d47bc5e8b`

  To retrieve the withdrawal information:

  1. Scan the `changes` for `0x1::coin::CoinStore<CoinType>`. Note the
  `CoinType`
  is a generic signifying which coin is stored in the store. In this example,
  the `CoinType` is `0x1337::my_coin::MyCoin`.
  2. Retrieve the `guid` for `withdraw_events`. In this example, the `guid`
  contains `addr`
  `0x810026ca8291dd88b5b30a1d3ca2edd683d33d06c4a7f7c451d96f6d47bc5e8b`
  and `creation_num` `3`.
  3. Scan for events with this `guid` and extract the event associated with it.
  In
  this example, it is the `0x1::coin::WithdrawEvent`.
  4. Note the `amount` field will be the number of `CoinType` removed from the
  account in the `guid`. In this example, it is `1000`.

  To retrieve the deposit information, it's the same as withdrawal except:

  1. The `guid` used is under `deposit_events`
  2. The `amount` will be a positive increase on the account's balance.
  3. The event's name will be: `0x1::coin::DepositEvent`

  To retrieve the gas fee:

  1. The `gas_used` field must be multiplied times the `gas_unit_price`. In this
  example, `gas_used=20` and `gas_unit_price=110` so the total gas coins
  withdrawn is `2200`.
  2. Gas is always: `0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin`

  To retrieve information about the number of decimals of the coin:

  1. You can retrieve the number of decimals for a coin via
  its: `0x1::coin::CoinInfo<CoinType>`
  2. This will be located at the address of the coin type. In this example, you
  would need to look up `0x1::coin::CoinInfo<0x1337::my_coin::MyCoin>` at  address `0x1337`.

  <Callout type="info">
    If you always use the events in this manner, you won't miss any balance
    changes
    for an account.
    By monitoring the events, you will find all balance changes in
    the `0x1::coin::CoinStore`:

    1. Coin mints
    2. Coin burns
    3. Coin transfers
    4. Staking coins
    5. Withdrawing staked coins
    6. Transfers not derived from `coin::transfer`

## Integrating with the faucet

This tutorial is for SDK and wallet developers who want to integrate with
the [Aptos
Faucet](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/main/crates/aptos-faucet).
If you are a dapp developer, you should access the faucet through an
existing [SDK](../guides/first-transaction.mdx)
or the [CLI](../cli.mdx) instead.

### Differences between devnet and testnet

What are the differences between devnet and testnet? Effectively none. In the
past, the testnet faucet had a Captcha in front of it, making it unqueryable
by
normal means. This is no longer true.

The endpoints for each faucet are:

- Devnet: https://faucet.devnet.aptoslabs.com
- Testnet: https://faucet.testnet.aptoslabs.com

### Calling the faucet: JavaScript / TypeScript

If you are building a client in JavaScript or TypeScript, you should make use
of the [@aptos-labs/aptos-faucet-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aptos-labs/aptos-faucet-client)
package. This client is generated based on the OpenAPI spec published by the
faucet service.

Example use:

```ts filename="index.ts"
import {
  AptosFaucetClient,
  FundRequest,
} from "@aptos-labs/aptos-faucet-client";

async function callFaucet(amount: number, address: string): Promise<string []> {
  const faucetClient = new AptosFaucetClient({
    BASE: "https://faucet.devnet.aptoslabs.com",
  });
  const request: FundRequest = {
    amount,
    address,
  };
  const response = await faucetClient.fund({ requestBody: request });
  return response.txn_hashes;
}
```

### Calling the faucet: Other languages

If you are trying to call the faucet in other languages, you have two options:

1. Generate a client from
the [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/crates/aptos-faucet/doc/spec.yaml).
2. Call the faucet on your own.

For the latter, you will want to build a query similar to this:

```bash filename="Terminal"
curl -X POST
'https://faucet.devnet.aptoslabs.com/mint?amount=10000&address=0xd0f523c9e73e6f3d68c16ae883a9febc616e484c4998a72d8899a1009e5a89d6'
```

This means mint 10000 OCTA to
address `0xd0f523c9e73e6f3d68c16ae883a9febc616e484c4998a72d8899a1009e5a89d6`.
