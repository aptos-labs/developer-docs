# Calculating the Signed Transaction Hash

When working with the Aptos, you may want to retrieve a transaction from the blockchain immediately after submitting it. To do this, you need the **signed transaction hash** (also known as `tx_hash`), which uniquely identifies the transaction on-chain.

While the Aptos REST API returns the transaction hash after submission, some developers may want to **precompute** it (e.g., for optimistic UIs, monitoring, or debugging purposes). This guide explains how to accurately compute the hash of a signed transaction.

Here is the installation link for the SDK we will use in this example:
- [Python SDK](../sdks/python-sdk.mdx)

To test this example you can try it after [your first transaction](./first-transaction.mdx)

## Process overview

Aptos uses a specific flow to generate the transaction hash:

1. Serialize the signed transaction using Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS).
2. Prepend a domain-specific prefix.
3. Hash the resulting bytes using SHA3-256.

Without proper serialization and prefixing, your calculated hash may not match the one on-chain.

## Code to Calculate the Transaction Hash

### Step 1: Serialize the signed transaction
We first convert the transaction data into a standardized binary format using Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS). This ensures consistent representation across different platforms.

```python
serializer = Serializer()
signed_txn.serialize(serializer)
bcs_bytes = serializer.output()
```

### Step 2: Create the domain separator hash
A domain separator adds context to prevent hash collisions between different types of data. We create a hash of the string "APTOS::Transaction".

```python
domain_separator = b"APTOS::Transaction"
prefix_hash = hashlib.sha3_256(domain_separator).digest()
```

### Step 3: Add the transaction variant
Different transaction types are identified by variant bytes. For user transactions, this is `0`.

```python
user_transaction_variant = bytes([0])
```

### Step 4: Create the final hash
We combine all components and generate the SHA3-256 hash.

```python
hash_input = prefix_hash + user_transaction_variant + bcs_bytes
hash_bytes = hashlib.sha3_256(hash_input).digest()
```

### Step 5: Format the result
Convert the binary hash to a hexadecimal string with a "0x" prefix.

```python
tx_hash = "0x" + hash_bytes.hex()
```

### Step 6: Full code block

```python
import hashlib
from aptos_sdk.transactions import SignedTransaction
from aptos_sdk.bcs import Serializer

def get_transaction_hash(signed_txn: SignedTransaction) -> str:
    # Step 1: Serialize the signed transaction using BCS
    serializer = Serializer()
    signed_txn.serialize(serializer)
    bcs_bytes = serializer.output()
    
    # Step 2: Prepare the domain-specific prefix hash
    domain_separator = b"APTOS::Transaction"
    prefix_hash = hashlib.sha3_256(domain_separator).digest()
    
    # Step 3: Prepend the variant byte for UserTransaction (0)
    user_transaction_variant = bytes([0])
    
    # Step 4: Concatenate all pieces and hash
    hash_input = prefix_hash + user_transaction_variant + bcs_bytes
    hash_bytes = hashlib.sha3_256(hash_input).digest()
    
    # Step 5: Convert to hexadecimal string with '0x' prefix
    tx_hash = "0x" + hash_bytes.hex()
    
    return tx_hash
```
