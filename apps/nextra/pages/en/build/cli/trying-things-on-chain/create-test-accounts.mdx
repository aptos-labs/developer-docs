# Create Test Accounts and Send Transactions From Aptos CLI

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
You can install the Aptos CLI by following [these steps](../../cli.mdx) if you have not done so already.
</Callout>

In general, to make a new account on-chain, you will need to generate keys and then fund the account. On test networks, you can fund a new account by asking a "faucet" account with test Aptos tokens to send them to your account.

Using the CLI, you can generate and fund a test account using:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos init --profile <your-profile-name>
```

Once you have a funded account you can send coins between accounts with the `transfer` command like this:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos account transfer --account superuser --amount 100
```

You should see a result like:

```json filename="Output"

}
```

This can be useful for manual testing of Move contracts or just to try seeing how the chain works in practice.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
To have more control over what your generated credentials look like, instead of `aptos init`, you can use:

1. `aptos key generate --vanity-prefix 0x<your-prefix>`
2. `aptos account fund-with-faucet --account <your-newly-generated-account-address>`

Note however that addresses are different than keys.
