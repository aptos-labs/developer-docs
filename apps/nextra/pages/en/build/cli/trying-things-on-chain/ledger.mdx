# Use Hardware Ledger via the Aptos CLI

Using a hardware wallet like Ledger is the most secure way to sign transactions on `mainnet` as your private key never leaves your device.

<Callout type="warning">
The `Ledger Nano S` has limited memory and may not be able to sign many transactions on Aptos. If you are trying to sign a transaction that is too big for your device to handle, you will get the error `Wrong raw transaction length`.
</Callout>

## Initial Setup

You will need to do a few steps of configuration for the Aptos CLI and your Ledger device to sign transactions.
<Steps>

### Ensure you have the Aptos CLI installed.
   You can install the Aptos CLI by following [these steps](../../cli.mdx) if you have not done so already.

### Ensure you have done the basic setup for your Ledger device.
   You can find those steps on [Ledger’s website](https://www.ledger.com/). For example, here are the set up instructions for the [Ledger Nano X](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018784134-Set-up-your-Ledger-Nano-X?docs=true).
### Plug your Ledger device into your computer.
### Install the Aptos App on your Ledger device by following [this guide](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/7326502672285-Aptos-APT?docs=true).
### Unlock your Ledger device and open the Aptos app.

   <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
   Whenever you want to sign using your Ledger you will need to plug it in, unlock it, and open the Aptos app before running any CLI commands.
   </Callout>

### Create a new Ledger profile in the Aptos CLI

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   aptos init --profile <your-profile> --ledger
   ```

   Then follow the terminal prompts like so:

   ```text filename="Terminal"
   Configuring for profile <your-profile>
   Choose network from [devnet, testnet, mainnet, local, custom | defaults to devnet]

   No network given, using devnet...
   Please choose an index from the following 5 ledger accounts, or choose an arbitrary index that you want to use:
   [0] Derivation path: m/44'/637'/0'/0'/0' (Address: 59836ba1dd0c845713bdab34346688d6f1dba290dbf677929f2fc20593ba0cfb)
   [1] Derivation path: m/44'/637'/1'/0'/0' (Address: 21563230cf6d69ee72a51d21920430d844ee48235e708edbafbc69708075a86e)
   [2] Derivation path: m/44'/637'/2'/0'/0' (Address: 667446181b3b980ef29f5145a7a2cc34d433fc3ee8c97fc044fd978435f2cb8d)

   ---
   Aptos CLI is now set up for account 59836ba1dd0c845713bdab34346688d6f1dba290dbf677929f2fc20593ba0cfb as profile <your-profile>!  Run `aptos --help` for more information about commands
   {
     "Result": "Success"
   }
   ```

   In the example, they chose to use the first ledger account by entering `0` after the `aptos init` command. You may choose whichever account you want.

   **Common errors:**

   1. If you see the error `Device Not Found`, make sure to unlock your Ledger then try this step again.
   2. If you see the error `Aptos ledger app is not opened`, make sure to open the Aptos app on your Ledger, then try this step again.

### Finally, you will need to enable blind signing on your Ledger device by following [these steps](https://medium.com/@DavidLehman24/how-to-enable-disable-blind-signing-on-ledger-wallet-99113a85cdad).
   1. Blind signing allows you to confirm a smart contract interaction you cannot verify through a human-readable language.
   2. This is needed to execute transactions without limitation as some payloads are too big to display.
</Steps>

## Signing Using Ledger

After doing the initial setup, you can sign transactions by following these steps:

1. Plug in your ledger.
2. Unlock it.
3. Open the Aptos app.
4. Run the Aptos CLI command which requires a signature.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
This process works for any command that requires a signature, whether that’s to transfer coins, publish a Move contract, interact with a contract, etc.
</Callout>

For example, if you wanted to publish a Move package like the `[hello_blockchain](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/main/aptos-move/move-examples/hello_blockchain)` demo contract you could follow the above steps then run:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos move publish --profile <your-ledger-profile-name> --named-addresses hello_blockchain=<your-ledger-profile-name>
```

You should see a response like:

```bash filename="Terminal"

{
  "Result": {
    "transaction_hash": "0xd5a12594f85284cfd5518d547d084030b178ee926fa3d8cbf699cc0596eff538",
    "gas_used": 1396,

    "success": true,
    "timestamp_us": 1689887104333038,
    "version": 126445,
    "vm_status": "Executed successfully"
  }
}

```

After you have approved publishing this package you will be prompted to sign the transaction on your Ledger device. Once signed, the package will be published to the network!

One error you might run into is `Error: Wrong raw transaction length`. This means that the transaction or package size was too big for your device to sign. Currently the Aptos Ledger app can only support transactions that are smaller than 20kb. The `Ledger Nano S` device has less memory than that, which is why it is more likely to produce this error.

## Authentication key rotation

If you have an active account that is not secured using a hardware wallet, then
you may wish to rotate the account's authentication key so that it corresponds
to a [BIP44 account index] private key held on your Ledger.

Alternatively, if you have an account linked with a Ledger hardware wallet that
you wish to publish a large package from, you might want to temporarily rotate
the account's authentication key to a hot key to avoid memory issues.

This tutorial will walk you through both scenarios.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="❗">
Before you start this tutorial make sure you have completed the
[key rotation guide](../../guides/key-rotation.mdx).
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Complete the key rotation guide

Confirm that you have completed the
[key rotation guide](../../guides/key-rotation.mdx).

### Verify your Ledger is ready

1. Connect and unlock your Ledger.
1. Check what version of the Aptos app you have: `Aptos > About > Version`.
1. If you do not have version `0.6.9` or higher, update it using Ledger Live.
1. Enable blind signing: `Aptos > Settings > Enable Blind Signing`.

### Start a localnet

Start a localnet:

```sh filename="Terminal"
aptos node run-localnet
```

The localnet is ready when it prints out:

```sh filename="Terminal"
Applying post startup steps...

Setup is complete, you can now use the localnet!
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="🧠">
If you are a power user on MacOS or Linux, the following command can be used
to start a fresh localnet as a background process:

```sh filename="Terminal"
mkdir -p localnet-data
aptos node run-localnet \
    --assume-yes \
    --test-dir localnet-data \
    --force-restart &
export LOCALNET_PID=$!
```

You can then stop the localnet at any point with the following command:

```sh filename="Terminal"
kill $LOCALNET_PID
```
</Callout>

### Set up localnet hot wallet profile

Create a private key corresponding to an authentication key, and thus initial
account address, that starts with the vanity prefix `0xaaa`:

```sh filename="Terminal"
aptos key generate \
    --assume-yes \
    --output-file private-key-a \
    --vanity-prefix 0xaaa
```

<details>
<summary>Example output</summary>
```sh filename="Terminal"
{
  "Result": {
    "PublicKey Path": "private-key-a.pub",
    "PrivateKey Path": "private-key-a",
    "Account Address:": "0xaaac71af5f2a4af4ec2639a15799bf9b945afb061c8bee102b636531c1b00eb5"
  }
}
```
</details>

Use the private key to initialize a `hot-wallet-1` profile on the localnet:

```sh filename="Terminal"
aptos init \
    --assume-yes \
    --network local \
    --private-key-file private-key-a \
    --profile hot-wallet-1
```

<details>
<summary>Example output</summary>
```sh filename="Terminal"

Aptos CLI is now set up for account 0xaaac71af5f2a4af4ec2639a15799bf9b945afb061c8bee102b636531c1b00eb5 as profile hot-wallet-1!  Run `aptos --help` for more information about commands
{
  "Result": "Success"
}
```
</details>

### Rotate the hot wallet key

Rotate the authentication key of the hot wallet to use [BIP44 account index]
1000 on your Ledger:

```sh filename="Terminal"
aptos account rotate-key \
    --assume-yes \
    --new-derivation-index 1000 \
    --profile hot-wallet-1 \
    --save-to-profile ledger-wallet-1000
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="🧠">
As a best practice, this command uses a [BIP44 account index] that starts at a
large number (1000) to indicate that the account is secured by a rotated
authentication key on a Ledger, to ensure it does not conflict with any other
existing accounts.

This practice aids in profile recovery, as shown below.
</Callout>

Follow the instructions from the CLI prompt:

```sh filename="Terminal"
Approve rotation proof challenge signature on your Ledger device
```

<details>
<summary>Example output</summary>
```sh filename="Terminal"
{
  "Result": {
    "message": "Saved new profile ledger-wallet-1000",

      "version": 186,
      "vm_status": "Executed successfully"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

Compare the `hot-wallet-1` and `ledger-wallet-1000` profiles, noting that they
have the same `account` address but different `public_key` values:

```sh filename="Terminal"
aptos config show-profiles --profile hot-wallet-1
aptos config show-profiles --profile ledger-wallet-1000
```

<details>
<summary>Example output</summary>
```sh filename="Terminal"

      "rest_url": "http://localhost:8080",
      "faucet_url": "http://localhost:8081"
    }
  }
}
{
  "Result": {
    "ledger-wallet-1000": {
      "has_private_key": false,
      "public_key": "0x20ba83f9b9fdab73b0ace8fda26ce24c98cf55060b72b69cfbd25add6a25d09b",
      "account": "aaa271bca468fb8518f73a732a484b29a1bc296ebcb23f15639d4865a5cebe87",
      "rest_url": "http://localhost:8080",
      "faucet_url": "http://localhost:8081"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

Since the account is no longer secured by the hot private key, delete the
private and public key files.

<Callout type="info" emoji="🧠">
If you are using a UNIX-like machine:

```shell filename="Terminal"
rm private-key-a
rm private-key-b
rm private-key-a.pub
rm private-key-b.pub
```
</Callout>

Now that you have successfully rotated the authentication key of the hot wallet,
you can delete the profiles too:

```sh filename="Terminal"
aptos config delete-profile --profile hot-wallet-1
aptos config delete-profile --profile ledger-wallet-1000
```

<details>
<summary>Example output</summary>
```sh filename="Terminal"
{
  "Result": "Deleted profile hot-wallet-1"
}
{
  "Result": "Deleted profile ledger-wallet-1000"
}
```
</details>

### Recover profile

Since you know that you rotated the authentication key of the hot wallet to the
Ledger, and since you used the best practice of a [BIP44 account index] offset
of 1000, you can easily recover the profile using the [BIP44 account index]
alone:

```sh filename="Terminal"
aptos init \
    --assume-yes \
    --derivation-index 1000 \
    --network local \
    --profile ledger-wallet-1000-recovered
```

---
Aptos CLI is now set up for account 0xaaac71af5f2a4af4ec2639a15799bf9b945afb061c8bee102b636531c1b00eb5 as profile ledger-wallet-1000-recovered!  Run `aptos --help` for more information about commands
{
  "Result": "Success"
}
```
</details>

Note that this profile corresponds to the specified `0xaaa...` vanity account
address:

```sh filename="Terminal"
aptos config show-profiles --profile ledger-wallet-1000-recovered
```

<details>
<summary>Example output</summary>
```sh filename="Terminal"
{
  "Result": {
    "ledger-wallet-1000-recovered": {
      "has_private_key": false,
      "public_key": "0x20ba83f9b9fdab73b0ace8fda26ce24c98cf55060b72b69cfbd25add6a25d09b",

      "rest_url": "http://localhost:8080",
      "faucet_url": "http://localhost:8081"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<Callout type="info" emoji="🧠">
The `aptos init` command first checks the [`account::OriginatingAddress`] table
for determining the account address associated with a public key, so as long as
you follow best practices from the
[key rotation guide](../../guides/key-rotation.mdx) and only
authenticate one account at a time with a private key, you'll easily be able to
recover your profile based on the [BIP44 account index] alone.
</Callout>

### Rotate to new hot private key

If you have an account linked with a Ledger hardware wallet that you wish to use
for publication of a large package, you'll be unable to sign the package
publication transaction due to the Ledger's memory limitations. In this case,
you'll want to temporarily rotate to a hot wallet.

Start by generating a new private key:

```sh filename="Terminal"
aptos key generate \
    --assume-yes \
    --output-file private-key-b \
    --vanity-prefix 0xbbb
```

<details>
<summary>Example output</summary>
```sh filename="Terminal"
{
  "Result": {
    "PublicKey Path": "private-key-b.pub",
    "PrivateKey Path": "private-key-b",
    "Account Address:": "0xbbbede2b4f1d49eff0b156ab0756889a6f2bb68f215399d5015da9ac45921b47"
  }
}
```
</details>

Rotate the authentication key of the account linked with the Ledger to the new
private key:

```sh filename="Terminal"
aptos account rotate-key \
    --assume-yes \
    --new-private-key-file private-key-b \
    --profile ledger-wallet-1000-recovered \
    --save-to-profile temporary-hot-wallet
```

Follow the instructions from the CLI prompt:

```sh filename="Terminal"
Approve rotation proof challenge signature on your Ledger device
```

```sh filename="Terminal"
Approve transaction on your Ledger device
```

<details>
<summary>Example output</summary>
```sh filename="Terminal"
{
  "Result": {
    "message": "Saved new profile temporary-hot-wallet",
    "transaction": {
      "transaction_hash": "0xe49782e92d8fd824fd6dce8f6ed42a11cf8ee84c201f3aa639c435e737c80eaa",
      "gas_used": 449,
      "gas_unit_price": 100,
      "sender": "aaac71af5f2a4af4ec2639a15799bf9b945afb061c8bee102b636531c1b00eb5",

      "version": 631,
      "vm_status": "Executed successfully"
    }
  }
```
</details>

Since the CLI profile `ledger-wallet-1000-recovered` is now stale, rename it
in case you get interrupted and forget that the private key has been rotated:

```sh filename="Terminal"
aptos config rename-profile \
    --profile ledger-wallet-1000-recovered \
    --new-profile-name ledger-wallet-1000-stale
```

<details>
<summary>Example output</summary>
```sh filename="Terminal"
{
  "Result": "Renamed profile ledger-wallet-1000-recovered to ledger-wallet-1000-stale"
}
```
</details>

### Rotate back to Ledger

Once you've signed the large package publication transaction with the hot key,
you can then rotate the authentication key back to to the corresponding to the
private key on the Ledger at index 1000:

```sh filename="Terminal"
aptos account rotate-key \
    --assume-yes \
    --new-derivation-index 1000 \
    --profile temporary-hot-wallet \
    --save-to-profile ledger-wallet-1000
```

Follow the instructions from the CLI prompt:

```sh filename="Terminal"
Approve rotation proof challenge signature on your Ledger device
```

<details>
<summary>Example output</summary>
```sh filename="Terminal"
{
  "Result": {
    "message": "Saved new profile ledger-wallet-1000",
    "transaction": {
      "transaction_hash": "0x9503819d4ea13bcd9eafed25984807d86d22e8a9837565a7495b54d13890d103",
      "gas_used": 449,
      "gas_unit_price": 100,
      "sender": "aaac71af5f2a4af4ec2639a15799bf9b945afb061c8bee102b636531c1b00eb5",

      "version": 742,
      "vm_status": "Executed successfully"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

Verify that the `ledger-wallet-1000-stale` and `ledger-wallet-1000` profiles
have the same `account` address and `public_key`:

```sh filename="Terminal"
aptos config show-profiles --profile ledger-wallet-1000-stale
aptos config show-profiles --profile ledger-wallet-1000
```

Delete the `temporary-hot-wallet` and `ledger-wallet-1000-stale` profiles,
which you no longer need.

```sh filename="Terminal"
aptos config delete-profile --profile temporary-hot-wallet
aptos config delete-profile --profile ledger-wallet-1000-stale
```

<details>
<summary>Example output</summary>
```sh filename="Terminal"
{
  "Result": "Deleted profile temporary-hot-wallet"
}
{
  "Result": "Deleted profile ledger-wallet-1000-stale"
}
```
</details>

Since you no longer need the temporary private key, delete it too.
