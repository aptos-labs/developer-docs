# Formatting Move Contracts

`movefmt` is a formatter tool that makes Move code much easier to write, read, and maintain — greatly improving the development experience on Aptos.

## Installation

`movefmt` is integrated into the Aptos CLI. To begin using it, first install it using the CLI update command.

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Install movefmt for first time usage
aptos update movefmt
```

To install a specific version of `movefmt`:

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Install movefmt with the target <VERSION>
aptos update movefmt --target-version <VERSION>
```

The latest release of `movefmt` can be found [here](https://github.com/movebit/movefmt/releases).

## Format your code


Similar to compilation and testing, you can use the following command to format the Move package:


```bash filename="Terminal"
# Format the Move package
aptos move fmt
```

Different ways of emitting the formatting result is supported:

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Format and overwrite all the target move files in the package.
# This is the default behavior if `--emit-mode` is not explicitly specified
aptos move fmt --emit-mode=overwrite

# Print the formatting result to terminal
aptos move fmt --emit-mode=std-out

# Print the formatting result to new files with the suffix `.fmt.out` in the same directory
aptos move fmt --emit-mode=new-file

# Print the difference between before and after formatting
aptos move fmt --emit-mode=diff
```

`movefmt` also provides different options to configure how the code will be formatted.
Here is the default configuration:

```
max_width = 90 # each line can have at most 90 characters
indent_size = 4 # the indent is 4 spaces
tab_spaces = 4 # each tab is identical to 4 spaces
hard_tabs = false # when a tab is inserted, it will be automatically replaced by 4 spaces
```

To override the default option, users can either specify a configuration file `movefmt.toml`
and put it in Move package directory or manually specify it in the command line:

```bash filename="Terminal"
# When formatting the code, set `max_width` to 80 and `indent_size` to 2
aptos move fmt --config max_width=80,indent_size=2
```
