# Formatting Move Contracts

`movefmt` is a formatter tool that makes Move code much easier to write, read, and maintain — greatly improving the development experience on Aptos.

## Installation

`movefmt` is integrated into the Aptos CLI. To begin using it, first install it using the CLI update command.

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Install movefmt for first time usage
aptos update movefmt
```

When a newer version of `movefmt` is available, use the following command to install it:

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Install movefmt with the target <VERSION>
aptos update movefmt --target-version <VERSION>
```

## Format your code


Similar to compilation and testing, you can use the following command to format the Move package:


```bash filename="Terminal"
# Format the Move package
aptos move fmt
```

Different ways of emitting the formatting result is supported:

```bash filename="Terminal"
# Format and overwrite the move file `target.move`
# This is the default behavior if `--emit-mode` is not explicitly specified
aptos move fmt --emit-mode=overwrite

# Print the formatting result to terminal
aptos move fmt --emit-mode=std-out

# Print the formatting result to new files
aptos move fmt --emit-mode=new-file

# Print the difference between before and after formatting
aptos move fmt --emit-mode=diff
```

`movefmt` also provides different options to configure how the code will be formatted.
Here is the default configuration,
which says 1) each line can have at most 90 characters, 2) the ident is 4 spaces,
3) each tab is identical 4 spaces and 4) when a tab is inserted, it will be automatically replaced by 4 spaces.

```
max_width = 90
indent_size = 4
tab_spaces = 4
hard_tabs = false
```

To override the default option, users can either specify a configuration file `movefmt.toml`
and put it in Move package directory or manually specify it in the command line:

```bash filename="Terminal"
# When formatting the code, set `max_width` to 80 and `indent_size` to 2
aptos move fmt --config max_width=80,indent_size=2
```
