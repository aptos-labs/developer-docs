# Install the Aptos CLI on Linux

For Linux, the easiest way to install the Aptos CLI tool is via shell script, although if that does not work, you can also install manually via downloading pre-compiled binaries. The pre-compiled binaries approach is not generally recommended as updating is very manual.

# Install via Script

<Steps>

### In the terminal, use one of the following commands:

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   curl -fsSL "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.sh" | sh
   ```

   Or use the equivalent `wget` command:

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   wget -qO- "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.sh" | sh
   ```

   <Callout type="warning">
     If you are getting `Illegal instruction` errors when running the CLI, it may be due to your CPU not supporting SIMD instructions.
     Specifically for older non-SIMD processors or Ubuntu x86_64 docker containers on ARM Macs, you may need to run the following command instead to skip SIMD instructions:
     ```bash filename="Terminal"
       curl -fsSL "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.sh" | sh -s -- --generic-linux
     ```
   </Callout>

### (Optional) It can be helpful to add the Aptos CLI to a folder in your PATH, or to add it to your PATH directly.
   - The steps to add a folder to your PATH are shell dependent.
   - You can run `echo $SHELL` to print the default shell for your machine, then google specific steps to add a folder to your PATH for that shell.
### Verify the script is installed by opening a new terminal and running `aptos help`
   - You should see a list of commands you can run using the CLI.
   - In the future, this is a helpful resource to learn exactly how each command works.

If you would like to update the Aptos CLI to the latest version, you can run `aptos update`.

# Install via Package Manager (Optional)

When installing Aptos via a package manager, please update it through the same package manager in the future.

### Arch Linux
#### Install via AUR (Arch User Repository)
```bash filename="Terminal"
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/aptos-bin.git
cd aptos-bin
makepkg -si
```
or use an AUR helper like `yay`:
```bash filename="Terminal"
yay -S aptos-bin
```
# Install via Pre-Compiled Binaries (Backup Method)

<Steps>
### Go to the [Aptos CLI release page](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases?q=cli&expanded=true).
### Click the "Assets" expandable menu for the latest release to see the pre-compiled binaries.
### Download the zip file for Linux.
   1. It’ll have a name like: `aptos-cli-<version>-Linux-x86_64.zip` or `aptos-cli-<version>-Linux-aarch64.zip`.
   2. Make sure you choose the right zip file for your computer architecture (x86_64 for Intel / AMD or aarch64 for ARM).
   3. You will likely have to dismiss warnings that this is a suspicious file when downloading.
### Unzip the downloaded file.
### Move the extracted Aptos binary file into your preferred folder.
### Open a terminal and navigate to your preferred folder.
### Make `~/aptos` an executable by running `chmod +x ~/aptos`.
### Verify that this installed version works by running `~/aptos help`.
   You should see instructions for how to use all CLI commands. These can be helpful in the future when you are trying to understand how to use specific commands.
### (Optional) It can be helpful to add the Aptos CLI to a folder in your PATH, or to add it to your PATH directly.
   - The steps to add a folder to your PATH are shell dependent.
   - You can run `echo $SHELL` to print the default shell for your machine, then google specific steps to add a folder to your PATH for that shell.

When using the pre-compiled binaries method, you can update the Aptos CLI by deleting your existing installation, then following the installation steps again.
