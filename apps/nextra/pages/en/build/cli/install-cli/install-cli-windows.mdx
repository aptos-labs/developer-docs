# Install the Aptos CLI on Windows

For Windows, the easiest way to install the Aptos CLI tool is via PowerShell script. If that does not work, you can also install manually via pre-compiled binaries. The pre-compiled binaries approach is not generally recommended as updating is very manual.

# Install via PowerShell Script
<Steps>
### In PowerShell, run the install script:

   ```powershell filename="Terminal"
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser; iwr https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.ps1 | iex
   ```

### Verify the script is installed by opening a new terminal and running `aptos help`.
   - You should see a list of commands you can run using the CLI.
   - In the future, this is a helpful resource to learn exactly how each command works.

If you would like to update the Aptos CLI to the latest version via script, you can run `aptos update`.
</Callout>

# Install via Package Manager (Optional)

When installing Aptos via a package manager, please update it through the same package manager in the future.
</Callout>

### If you have [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) installed, you can run the following command to install the Aptos CLI:

   ```powershell filename="Terminal"
   scoop install https://aptos.dev/scoop/aptos.json
   ```
### If you have [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) installed, you can run the following command to install the Aptos CLI:

   ```powershell filename="Terminal"
   choco install aptos
   ```
### If you have [winget](https://winget.run/) installed, you can run the following command to install the Aptos CLI:

   ```powershell filename="Terminal"
   winget install aptos
   ```

# Install via Pre-Compiled Binaries (Backup Method)

<Steps>
### Go to the [Aptos CLI release page](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases?q=cli&expanded=true).
### Expand "Assets" to see the pre-compiled binaries.
### Download the zip file for Windows.
   - It will have a name like: `aptos-cli-<version>-Windows-x86_64.zip`
   - You will likely have to dismiss warnings that this is a suspicious file when downloading.
### Unzip the downloaded file.
   - Move the file to whichever folder you would like to call `aptos` from in the future.
### Right click, then copy the path to the executable.
   Ex. `C:\Users\<username>\Downloads\aptos-cli-3.1.0-Windows-x86_64\aptos.exe`.
   <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
   You may want to add this path to your PATH environment variable to simplify calling the Aptos CLI going forward.
   </Callout>
### Open PowerShell via the Start Menu.
### Verify the installation by running the `help` command.
   Use the path you copied earlier to call the Aptos CLI.
   Ex. `C:\Users\<username>\Downloads\aptos-cli-3.1.0-Windows-x86_64\aptos.exe help`.
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
When installing with pre-compiled binaries, you can update the Aptos CLI by deleting your existing installation, then following the installation steps again.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
If neither of the above methods work, you will have to build the CLI from source by following these steps: [Install Specific Aptos CLI Versions (Advanced)](install-cli-specific-version.mdx)
