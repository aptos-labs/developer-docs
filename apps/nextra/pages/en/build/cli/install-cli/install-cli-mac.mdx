# Install the Aptos CLI on Mac

For Mac, the easiest way to install the Aptos CLI is with the package manager `brew`.

# Installation

<Steps>
### Ensure you have `brew` installed https://brew.sh/.
### Open a new terminal and enter the following commands.

brew update
brew install aptos
```

### Open another terminal and run `aptos help` to verify the CLI is installed.

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos help
```
</Steps>

If `brew` does not work for you, you can try the steps here: [Install Specific Aptos CLI Versions (Advanced)](install-cli-specific-version.mdx)
