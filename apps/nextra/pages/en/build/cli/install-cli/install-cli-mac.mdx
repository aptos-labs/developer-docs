# Install the Aptos CLI on Mac

For Mac, the easiest way to install the Aptos CLI is with the package manager `brew`.

# Installation

<Steps>
### Ensure you have `brew` installed https://brew.sh/.
### Open a new terminal and enter the following commands.

```bash filename="Terminal"
brew update
brew install aptos
```

### Open another terminal and run `aptos help` to verify the CLI is installed.

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos help
```
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
If `brew` does not work for you, you can try the steps here: [Install via Script](#install-via-script) or [Install via Pre-Compiled Binaries](#install-via-pre-compiled-binaries-backup-method).)
</Callout>

# Upgrading the CLI

Upgrading the CLI with brew just takes 2 commands:

```bash filename="Terminal"
brew update
brew upgrade aptos
```

# Install via Script

<Steps>
  ### In the terminal, use one of the following commands:

  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  curl -fsSL "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.sh" | sh
  ```

  Or use the equivalent `wget` command:

  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  wget -qO- "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.sh" | sh
  ```

  ### (Optional) It can be helpful to add the Aptos CLI to a folder in your PATH, or to add it to your PATH directly.
  - The steps to add a folder to your PATH are shell dependent.
  - You can run `echo $SHELL` to print the default shell for your machine, then google specific steps to add a folder to your PATH for that shell.
  ### Verify the script is installed by opening a new terminal and running `aptos help`
  - You should see a list of commands you can run using the CLI.
  - In the future, this is a helpful resource to learn exactly how each command works.

# Install via Pre-Compiled Binaries (Backup Method)

<Steps>
  ### Go to the [Aptos CLI release page](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases?q=cli&expanded=true).
  ### Click the "Assets" expandable menu for the latest release to see the pre-compiled binaries.
  ### Download the zip file for macOS.
  1. It’ll have a name like: `aptos-cli-<version>-macOS-x86_64.zip` or `aptos-cli-<version>-macOS-arm64.zip`.
  2. Make sure you choose the right zip file for your computer architecture (x86_64 for Intel / AMD or arm64 for ARM).
  3. You will likely have to dismiss warnings that this is a suspicious file when downloading.
  ### Unzip the downloaded file.
  ### Move the extracted Aptos binary file into your preferred folder.
  ### Open a terminal and navigate to your preferred folder.
  ### Make `~/aptos` an executable by running `chmod +x ~/aptos`.
  ### Verify that this installed version works by running `~/aptos help`.
  You should see instructions for how to use all CLI commands. These can be helpful in the future when you are trying to understand how to use specific commands.
  ### (Optional) It can be helpful to add the Aptos CLI to a folder in your PATH, or to add it to your PATH directly.
  - The steps to add a folder to your PATH are shell dependent.
  - You can run `echo $SHELL` to print the default shell for your machine, then google specific steps to add a folder to your PATH for that shell.

</Steps>

  When using the pre-compiled binaries method, you can update the Aptos CLI by deleting your existing installation, then following the installation steps again.
