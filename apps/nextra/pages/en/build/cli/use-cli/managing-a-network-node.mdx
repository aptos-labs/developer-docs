# Managing a Network Node via Aptos CLI

If you are running a [validator node or validator full node (VFN)](../../../nodes/validator-node/index.mdx), you can use the CLI to interact with your node.

Specifically, you can use the CLI to:

1. [Manage staking pools you own](../../../nodes/validator-node/operator/staking-pool-operations.mdx).
2. [Vote on proposals](../../../nodes/validator-node/voter/index.mdx).

Beyond that, you can run this help command to see more specialized commands the CLI can do relating to operating your node:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos node --help
```
