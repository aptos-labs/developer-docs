# Trying Things On-Chain With Aptos CLI

The CLI can be a convenient tool for quickly looking up on-chain data and sending transactions from your accounts.

The most common way to specify what accounts you want to interact with is through profiles. You can create a new profile on the cli by running the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos init --profile <your-profile-name>
```

If any command takes an account, you can pass in the name of a profile instead. If a command implicitly uses the default profile, it will usually have an optional parameter to use a specified profile instead which you can find by running `aptos <your-command> --help`.

With that, the three main things you can use the CLI to do on-chain include:

1. [Looking Up On-Chain Account Info](trying-things-on-chain/looking-up-account-info.mdx)
2. [Creating test accounts and sending transactions](trying-things-on-chain/create-test-accounts.mdx)
3. [Securely interacting on-chain via a Hardware Ledger](trying-things-on-chain/ledger.mdx)
