# Aptos CLI

The Aptos command line interface (CLI) is a tool to help you compile and test Move contracts. It can also help you quickly play with Aptos features on-chain.

For more advanced users, the CLI can also be used to run a private Aptos network (to help test code locally) and can be helpful managing a network node.

If you run into problems installing or using the CLI, feel free to search or post in Aptosâ€™s [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).
