# Create Aptos Dapp Telegram Clicker Game Mini App Template

This template provides a ready to use clicker game dapp that can be run as a Telegram Mini App.

We provide 2 signing experience for the Telegram Mini App, you can choose one of them during the setup:
- explicit signing - the user needs to sign each transaction, this is powered by Aptos Wallet Adapter similar to other dapps
  - [demo](https://t.me/aptos_explict_siging_bot/)
- seamless signing - the user doesn't need to sign each transaction because the approval is done in the background, this is powered by [Mizu Wallet SDK Core](https://docs.mizu.io/docs/api-connect/core)
  - [demo](https://t.me/seamless345_bot/)

## Getting started

<Steps>

### Publish the contract

Run the below command to publish the contract on-chain:
```bash
npm run move:publish
```
This command will:
1. Publish the contract to chain.
2. Setting the `VITE_MODULE_ADDRESS` in the `.env` file to set the contract object address.

### Create a Telegram bot

Start a chat with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.

### (Optional)  Obtain the app ID from Mizu wallet

If you choose the seamless signing experience, you are using `@mizuwallet-sdk/core` instead of Aptos Wallet Adapter. You need to obtain a Mizu App ID from the Mizu team by filling up their [form](https://ankaalabs.typeform.com/to/bAPqSxDu). Once you have the App ID, set it in the `.env` file as `VITE_MIZU_WALLET_APP_ID`.

You can learn more about using it in the [Mizu doc](https://docs.mizu.io/docs/api-connect/core).

### Host the frontend

Host the frontend on Vercel or any other hosting service.

### Create a Telegram mini app

Use the `/newapp` commend to create a new mini app and link the mini app with the bot you just created. When BotFather asks for the mini app's URL, provide the URL of the frontend you deployed.

### Set the menu button of the bot to open the mini app

Use the `/mybots` command to find your bot, choose `bot settings` -> `menu button` -> `configure menu button`, provide the mini app's name and URL. Now you can access the mini app from your bot's menu.

</Steps>

## Ready for Mainnet

If you started your dapp on testnet, and you are happy with your testing, you will want to get the dapp on mainnet.

To publish the smart contract on mainnet, we need to change some configuration.

1. Change the `VITE_APP_NETWORK` value to `mainnet` in the `.env` file
2. Run `npm run move:init` to initialize an account to work against Mainnet
3. If you already have an account you would like to use to publish the contract under, you can pass its private key when the prompt asks for that.
4. If you are generating a new account, you need to transfer this account some APT on Aptos Mainnet since the tool canâ€™t fund the account when it is against Mainnet.
5. Check: open `.aptos/config.yaml` file and see that you have a profile under the `{PROJECT_NAME}-mainnet` name (where `PROJECT_NAME` is specified in your `.env` file). In addition, open the `.env` file and check the `VITE_MODULE_ADDRESS` value is the same as the new profile's account account address.
7. Finally, run `npm run move:publish` to publish your move module on Aptos mainnet.
