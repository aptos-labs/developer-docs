# Create Aptos Dapp Boilerplate Template

The Boilerplate template provides a starter dapp with all necessary dapp infrastructure and a simple wallet info implementation.

The Boilerplate template provides:

- Folder structure - A pre-made dapp folder structure with `frontend` and `move` folders.
- Dapp infrastructure - All required dependencies a dapp needs to start building on the Aptos network.
- Wallet Info implementation - Pre-made `WalletInfo` components to demonstrate how one can use to read a connected Wallet info.

## Getting started

<Steps>

### On the project root folder, use the below command to initiliaze an account to publish the contract with.

```bash 
npm run move:init
```

The CLI will prompt you to provide the private key for your wallet in order for the tool to publish the contract on your behalf. If you provide no input, it will generate one for you.

This will create an account you will later publish the contract with, as well as setting the `VITE_MODULE_ADDRESS` in the `.env` file to set the contract object address.

For example:
```bash filename=".env"
PROJECT_NAME=my-aptos-dapp
VITE_APP_NETWORK=testnet
```

### On the project root folder, run the below command to publish the contract.

```bash
npm run move:publish
```
<Callout type="info">
You will have to confirm the gas fee in the console.
</Callout>

This command will publish the contract to chain.

### Run the app and open the preview.

```bash
npm run dev
```

</Steps>

### Building the frontend

The boilerplate template utilizes React as the frontend framework and Vite as the development tool, and is styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
All dapp components should be added into the `components` folder and it is recommended to create a `page` folder to hold all future pages in your project.

### Writing a Move contract

The boilerplate template comes with a `move` folder that holds all Move related files. Under the `sources` folder you will find a `.move` file with a super basic implementation of a Move module that lets you store a message and update it. This is to help you with to get started with writing your own Smart Contract.

### Smart contract and frontend communication

For a frontend to submit a transaction to a smart contract, it needs to call an entry function. The boilerplate provides you with an `entry-functions` folder to hold all your dapp entry function requests.
Additionaly, for a frontend to fetch data from a smart contract, it needs to submit a request to a view function. The boilerplate provides you with a `view-functions` folder to hold all your dapp view function requests.

## Ready for Mainnet

If you started your dapp on testnet, and you are happy with your testing, you will want to get the dapp on mainnet.

To publish the smart contract on mainnet, we need to change some configuration.

1. Change the `VITE_APP_NETWORK` value to `mainnet` in the `.env` file
2. Run `npm run move:init` to initialize an account to work against Mainnet
3. If you already have an account you would like to use to publish the contract under, you can pass its private key when the prompt asks for that.
4. If you are generating a new account, you need to transfer this account some APT on Aptos Mainnet since the tool canâ€™t fund the account when it is against Mainnet.
5. Check: open `.aptos/config.yaml` file and see that you have a profile under the `{PROJECT_NAME}-mainnet` name (where `PROJECT_NAME` is specified in your `.env` file). In addition, open the `.env` file and check the `VITE_MODULE_ADDRESS` value is the same as the new profile's account account address.
7. Finally, run `npm run move:publish` to publish your move module on Aptos mainnet.

## Deploy to a live server

`create-aptos-dapp` provides an npm command to easily deploy the static site to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home). 

At the root of the folder, simply run 

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm run deploy
```

Then, follow the prompts. Please refer to Vercel docs to learn more about the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli)

If you are looking for different services to deploy the static site to, `create-aptos-dapp` utilizes Vite as the development tool, so you can follow the [Vite deployment guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy). In a nutshell, you would need to:

1. Run `npm run build` to build a static site
2. Run `npm run preview` to see how your dapp would look like on a live server
3. Next, all you need is to deploy your static site to a live server, there are some options for you to choose from and can follow [this guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy) on how to use each
