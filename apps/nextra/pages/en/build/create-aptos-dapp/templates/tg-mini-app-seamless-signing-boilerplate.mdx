# Create Aptos Dapp Telegram Mini App Boilerplate Template

This template is made from the [boilerplate template](https://github.com/aptos-labs/create-aptos-dapp/tree/main/templates/boilerplate-template), the difference is that we make this possible to run as a Telegram mini app, and we change the app to be a simple clicker game.

The difference between this template and the [tg-mini-app-boilerplate-template](https://aptos.dev/en/build/create-aptos-dapp/templates/tg-mini-app-boilerplate) is we are using [@mizuwallet-sdk/core](https://docs.mizu.io/docs/api-connect/core) instead of Aptos Wallet Adapter that gives you more control on the wallet flow, this way we achieve a seamless signing experience, i.e. users no longer need to approve the transaction explicitly.

You can access a live demo of the mini app by starting a chat with the example bot https://t.me/seamless345_bot/.

See the [boilerplate template doc](https://aptos.dev/en/build/create-aptos-dapp/templates/boilerplate) for details about the boilerplate template itself. 

After you have followed the boilerplate template doc instructions to [publish the contract](https://aptos.dev/en/build/create-aptos-dapp/templates/boilerplate#getting-started), you can follow the steps below to make the dapp runnable as a Telegram mini app.
<Steps>

### Create a Telegram bot

Start a chat with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.

### Obtain the app ID from Mizu wallet

In order to achieve a seamless signing experience, we use [@mizuwallet-sdk/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mizuwallet-sdk/core) directly instead of the Wallet Adapter in this template, follow the [Mizu doc](https://docs.mizu.io/docs/api-connect/core) to add it to your project.

Then contact the [Mizu team](https://mizu.io/) to get the app ID by providing the bot's token.

### Deploy the frontend

Fill in `VITE_MIZU_WALLET_APP_ID` in `.env` with the app ID you obtained from the Mizu team. Then deploy the frontend.

### Create a Telegram mini app

Use the `/newapp` command to create a new mini app and link the mini app with the bot you just created. When BotFather asks for the mini app's URL, provide the URL of the frontend you deployed.

### Set the menu button of the bot to open the mini app

Use the `/mybots` command to find your bot, choose `bot settings` -> `menu button` -> `configure menu button`, provide the mini app's name and URL. Now you can access the mini app from your bot's menu.
