# Create Aptos Dapp Telegram Mini App Boilerplate Template

This template is built from the [boilerplate template](https://aptos.dev/en/build/create-aptos-dapp/templates/boilerplate) and make it runnable as a telegram mini app.

See the doc for boilerplate template for details about the template itself. 

You can access a live demo of the mini app by starting a chat with the example bot https://t.me/seamless345_bot/.

After you have followed the boilerplate template doc instructions to publish the contract, you can follow the steps below to make the dapp runnable as a telegram mini app.

<Steps>

### Create a telegram bot

Start a chat with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.

### Obtain the app ID from mizu wallet

In order to achieve a seamless signing experience, we use [Mizu sdk core](<path-to-mizu-sdk-core>) directly instead of the Wallet Adapter in this template, this allows us to bypass the confirmation dialog when signing a transaction. In order to use mizu sdk core, we need to get an app ID from the mizu team. You can contact the Mizu team by dm their [X account](https://x.com/MizuWallet) and provide them your telegram bot's token.

### Deploy the frontend

Fill in `VITE_MIZU_WALLET_APP_ID` in `.env` with the app ID you obtained from the mizu team. Then deploy the frontend.

### Create a telegram mini app

Use the `/newapp` command to create a new mini app and link the mini app with the bot you just created. When BotFather asks for the mini app's URL, provide the URL of the frontend you deployed.

### Set the menu button of the bot to open the mini app

Use the `/mybots` command to find your bot, choose `bot settings` -> `menu button` -> `configure menu button`, provide the mini app's name and URL. Now you can access the mini app from your bot's menu.
