# Create Aptos Dapp Telegram Mini App Boilerplate Template

This template is made from the [boilerplate template](https://github.com/aptos-labs/create-aptos-dapp/tree/main/templates/boilerplate-template), the difference is that we make this possible to run as a Telegram mini app, and we change the app to be a simple clicker game.

The difference between this template and the [tg-mini-app-seamless-signing-boilerplate-template](https://aptos.dev/en/build/create-aptos-dapp/templates/tg-mini-app-seamless-signing-boilerplate) is we are using Aptos Wallet Adapter instead of Mizu wallet sdk core, this way the UX is similar to all other dapps using the Wallet Adapter, i.e. users need to approve the transaction explicitly. Also since Mizu is the only Aptos wallet supports Telegram now, we removed other wallet options.

You can access a live demo of the mini app by starting a chat with the example bot https://t.me/aptos_explict_siging_bot/.

Follow the [boilerplate template doc](https://aptos.dev/en/build/create-aptos-dapp/templates/boilerplate) to learn how to test, publish the contract and deploy the frontend. After that you can follow the steps below to make the dapp runnable as a Telegram mini app.

<Steps>

### Create a Telegram bot

Start a chat with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.

### Create a Telegram mini app

Use the `/newapp` commend to create a new mini app and link the mini app with the bot you just created. When BotFather asks for the mini app's URL, provide the URL of the frontend you deployed.

### Set the menu button of the bot to open the mini app

Use the `/mybots` command to find your bot, choose `bot settings` -> `menu button` -> `configure menu button`, provide the mini app's name and URL. Now you can access the mini app from your bot's menu.

</Steps>
