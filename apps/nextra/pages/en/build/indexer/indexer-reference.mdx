# Indexer API Reference

The Indexer API allows you to access rich data about tokens, accounts, transactions, and events on-chain using GraphQL queries.

You can interactively explore the data discussed here using Hasura explorers here:

Or via code at the following endpoints:

- **Mainnet:** `https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/graphql`
- **Testnet:** `https://api.testnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/graphql`
- **Devnet:** `https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/graphql`

You can also find a list of the most common queries in the sidebar under example queries.

As you explore, you can refer back to these reference docs to understand the tables you are interested in. You should use Ctrl + F to quickly find the right entry for that table.

At the bottom of this page we list the tables which are deprecated, along with any alternatives which may replace them. 
Make sure to check the list before building any production infrastructure that relies heavily on specific Indexer tables.

<Callout type="info">
If you are looking up a table with the `_by_pk` suffix, search for the table name without that suffix. `_by_pk` tables are automatically generated for convenience to allow querying by primary key.
