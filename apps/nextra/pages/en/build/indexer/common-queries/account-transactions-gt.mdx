# Get Recent Account Transactions

`GetAccountTransactionsDataGt` gets transactions impacting a specific account that are at least as recent as a given transaction version. This can be useful for only checking the most recent transactions.

#### Variables:
- `$address`: **String** - The blockchain account address for which to query transaction data. Example: `"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"`.
- `$limit`: **Integer** - Specifies the maximum number of transaction versions to return. This helps limit the results to a manageable size. Example: `10`.
- `$gt`: **bigint** - The transaction version number above which transactions should be fetched. A transaction version is a sequentially increasing number that increments for every transaction.
Transaction version 0 is the first transaction (genesis transaction), and a transaction version 100 is the 101st transaction in the blockchain.
 Example: `582607591`.
