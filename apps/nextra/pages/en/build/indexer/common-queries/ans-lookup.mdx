# Get Name From Address

`getNameFromAddress` looks for a registered domain name for a given account. For example, a user could register their account with the Aptos Name Service to be associated to `love.apt`. You can learn more by going to https://www.aptosnames.com/.

<Callout type="warning">
This only returns *active* names. Name registrations can expire if not renewed, which may explain some empty results.

<Callout type="info">
Try it yourself! You can customize the variables at the bottom of the editor.
