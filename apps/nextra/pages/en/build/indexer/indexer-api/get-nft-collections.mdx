# Retrieve NFT Collections Owned by an Account

`GetAccountNftCollections` fetches detailed information about NFT collections owned by a specific account address. This includes data such as the collection ID, distinct token count within each collection, and detailed attributes of each collection. It's particularly useful for applications that need to display comprehensive details about NFT holdings associated with an account.
