# NFT Aggregator API

<Callout type="info">
The NFT Aggregator API is currently in beta. If you’re building an aggregator or need real-time event streaming via gRPC, please reach out to our team for early access and support!
</Callout>

We’re building a **universal NFT aggregator** for the Aptos ecosystem that normalizes activity across all major marketplaces — including **Tradeport**, **Wapal**, **bluemove**, **Souffl3**, **Topaz**, and more.

At its core, the aggregator captures marketplace events in real-time (like listings, token offers, and collection-wide offers) and converts them into clean, structured data.  
This allows developers to work with a unified data format — no need to handle different marketplace-specific formats manually.

You can access this data through two main API categories:  
- **GraphQL** for querying live activity
- **REST** for analytics and aggregated metrics

For more information on the NFT Aggregator API, see the [NFT Aggregator API Reference](./nft-aggregator-reference.mdx).

## GraphQL API (NFT Activity)

Query real-time marketplace activity across supported marketplaces.  
Use this for:
- Active listings
- Token offers
- Collection offers

For direct GraphQL queries to the Aptos-Labs hosted Indexer API, use these endpoints:
- console: https://console.nft-aggregator-staging.gcp.aptosdev.com/console/api/api-explorer
- Mainnet: https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/nft-aggregator/v1/graphql

## REST API (Analytics)

Access aggregated data like:
- Total sales volume
- Top buyers/sellers
- Marketplace trends

<Callout type="info">
Analytics API is currently in beta.  
For custom analytics pipelines, we recommend using our gRPC stream for raw structured events.
