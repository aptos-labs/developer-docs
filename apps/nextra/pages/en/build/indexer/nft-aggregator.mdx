# NFT Aggregator API

import { IndexerBetaNotice, Card, Cards } from '@components/index';
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

We've built a **universal NFT aggregator** for the Aptos ecosystem - normalized activity across all major marketplaces, including **Tradeport**, **Wapal**, **Bluemove**, **Rarible**, and more. We also maintain historical data for deprecated marketplaces like **Topaz**.

At its core, the aggregator captures marketplace events in real-time (like listings, token offers, and collection-wide offers) and converts them into clean, structured data. This allows developers to work with a unified data format — no need to handle different marketplace-specific formats manually.

## What We Provide

- **[GraphQL API](./nft-aggregator/graphql-api.mdx)** for querying activities
- **[Analytics REST API](./nft-aggregator/analytics-api.mdx)** for aggregated analytics
- Marketplace integration support for new partners  

Our API supports two main use cases:
- **Historical Data tracking:** Listings, NFT Token Offers, NFT Collection Offers — in real-time.
- **Analytics & Trends:** Aggregate data, market insights, top traders, and more.

## GraphQL API
Query real-time marketplace activity across all integrated marketplaces. Use this for:
- Basic historical data
- Aggregated data (e.g. how many listings are there for a given collection)

You can explore it by hand by viewing the Hasura Explorer below for the network you are interested in.
- Hasura Console: https://cloud.hasura.io/public/graphiql?endpoint=https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/nft-aggregator/v1/graphql

For direct GraphQL queries to the Aptos-Labs hosted Indexer API, use these endpoints:
- Mainnet Graphql Endpoint: https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/nft-aggregator/v1/graphql
