# NFT Aggregator API

import { IndexerBetaNotice, Card, Cards } from '@components/index';
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

<Callout type="info">
The NFT Aggregator API is currently in beta. If youâ€™re building an aggregator or need real-time event streaming via gRPC, please reach out to our team for early access and support!
</Callout>

Weâ€™re building a **universal NFT aggregator** for the Aptos ecosystem - normalized activity across all major marketplaces, including **Tradeport**, **Wapal**, **bluemove**, **Souffl3**, **Topaz**, and more.

At its core, the aggregator captures marketplace events in real-time (like listings, token offers, and collection-wide offers) and converts them into clean, structured data. This allows developers to work with a unified data format â€” no need to handle different marketplace-specific formats manually.

## What We Provide

- **[GraphQL API](./nft-aggregator/graphql-api.mdx)** for querying activities
- **[Analytics REST API](./nft-aggregator/analytics-api.mdx)** for aggregated analytics
- Marketplace integration support for new partners  

Our API supports two main use cases:
- **Historical Data tracking:** Listings, NFT Token Offers, NFT Collection Offers â€” in real-time.
- **Analytics & Trends:** Aggregate data, market insights, top traders, and more.

## GraphQL API
Query real-time marketplace activity across all integrated marketplaces. Use this for:
- Basic historical data
- Aggregated data (e.g. how many listings are there for a given collection)

You can explore it by hand by viewing the Hasura Explorer below for the network you are interested in.
- Hasura Console: https://console.nft-aggregator-staging.gcp.aptosdev.com/console/api/api-explorer

For direct GraphQL queries to the Aptos-Labs hosted Indexer API, use these endpoints:
- Mainnet Graphql Endpoint: https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/nft-aggregator-staging/v1/graphql

you can find the full API reference [here](./nft-aggregator/graphql-api.mdx).

## Analytics REST API 
<Callout type="info">
Analytics API is currently in beta.  
For custom analytics pipelines, we recommend using our gRPC stream for raw structured events.
</Callout>

Get high-level insights and historical data on the NFT market. Use this analytics API for:
- Total sales volumes
- Top buyers and sellers
- Marketplace trends

You can find the full API reference [here](./nft-aggregator/analytics-api.mdx).
