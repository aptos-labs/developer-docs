## Architecture of the Indexer SDK

In the Aptos indexing stack, a processor indexes a specific subset of data from the blockchain and writes the data into an external database.

Each processor follows this general flow:

1. Receive a stream of transactions from [Transaction Stream](../txn-stream.mdx)
2. Extract the relevant data from the transactions and transform it into a standardized schema
3. Store the transformed data into a database
4. Keep track of the transaction versions that have been processed

The Indexer SDK allows you to write a processor as a directed graph of independent steps. 
Each `Step` has an input and output, and the output of each `Step` is connected to the input of the next `Step` by a [Kanal channel](https://github.com/fereidani/kanal).

## When to use the Indexer SDK
The Indexer SDK is useful when you want to index a custom contract or you realize you need a new kind of data that isn't available in the [Indexer API](../indexer-api.mdx).

The general flow to write a custom processor with the Indexer SDK is:
1. Define your database schema
2. Create a new processor
3. Create `Step`s that extract and transform data into your storage schema 
2. Customize your processor by adding and connecting steps
3. Run your processor and see the data indexed into your database

## Benefits of the Indexer SDK
The Indexer SDK's architecture simplifies writing custom processors in several ways:

1. You can reuse `Step` implementations across processors which reduces duplication of common data extraction logic. 
2. The SDK collects basic performance metrics, like the number of transactions processed, for each `Step`, which enables observability into subcomponents of the processor. 
3. Since each `Step` is independent, you can safely customize parts of the processor without breaking the other pieces. 
For example, you can add additional `Step`'s to pre/post-process data or batch data writes. Each `Step` can also be tested in isolation from the rest of the processor.
