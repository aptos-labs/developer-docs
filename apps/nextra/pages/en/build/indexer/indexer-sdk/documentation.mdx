## Architecture of the Indexer SDK

In the Aptos indexing stack, a processor indexes a specific subset of data from the blockchain and ingests the data into an external database.

Each processor follows this general flow:

1. Receive a stream of Aptos transactions
2. Extract the relevant data from the transactions
3. Transform and merge the extracted data into a coherent, standardized schema
4. Store the transformed data into a database

The Aptos Indexer SDK allows you to write and model each of your processor as a graph of independent `Step`'s'.
Each `Step` has an input and an output, and the output of one `Step` is connected to the input of another `Step` by a channel.
The flow above can be modeled as a graph of `Step`'s connected by channels.

The Indexer SDK's architecture simplifies writing custom processors in several ways:

1. You can reuse `Step` implementations across processors which reduces duplication of common data extraction logic. 
2. The SDK collects basic performance metrics, like the number of transactions processed, for each `Step`, which enables observability into subcomponents of the processor. 
3. Since each `Step` is independent, you can safely customize parts of the processor without breaking the other pieces. 
For example, you can add additional `Step`'s to pre/post-process data or batch data writes. Each `Step` can also be tested in isolation from the rest of the processor.
