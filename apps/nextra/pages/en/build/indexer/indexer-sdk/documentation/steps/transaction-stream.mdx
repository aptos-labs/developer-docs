# Transaction Stream Step

The `TransactionStreamStep` is a foundational component in the transaction processing pipeline. It establishes a gRPC connection with the `TransactionStream` service, fetches transactions in batches, and outputs them for further processing. This step also manages connection retries and reconnections in case of transient failures. Typically, this is the initial step in a processor, responsible for streaming transactions for downstream steps.

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Fetch Transactions**: Retrieves transaction batches from a gRPC service.
2. **Manage Connections**: Handles gRPC reconnections to ensure a resilient stream.
3. **Provide Metadata**: Attaches contextual information like versions and timestamps to the transactions.

## Struct Definition

The `TransactionStreamStep` struct is defined as follows:

```rust
pub struct TransactionStreamStep
where
    Self: Sized + Send + 'static,
{
    transaction_stream_config: TransactionStreamConfig,
    pub transaction_stream: Mutex<TransactionStreamInternal>,
}
```

## How It Works

- The `TransactionStreamStep` connects to the gRPC `TransactionStream` service.
- It continuously polls for new transactions using the `poll` method.
- Each batch is wrapped in a `TransactionContext`, which includes metadata such as:
  - Start and end versions.
  - Timestamps of transactions.
  - Batch size in bytes.
- If the connection is interrupted, it attempts to reconnect seamlessly.
