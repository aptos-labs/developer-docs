# Defining a Data Schema

The first step with indexing is choosing a database and defining a schema for the data that you want to store. 

## Schema Considerations
When designing an indexer data schema, consider the following:
- Customizability: A schema serves as an interface for your dApp to access data tailored to your specific contract or application. 
Ensure your schema is customized to meet your dApp's unique requirements.
- Query Optimization: A well-designed schema can enable more efficient data retrieval, supporting advanced operations such as aggregations, complex filtering, and table joins.
- Enhanced Performance: Schema design can significantly improve your dApp's performance. 
By using the indexer, a single indexer query can often replace multiple queries to the fullnode.

## Aptos Core Processors
All data exposed by the [Indexer API](../../indexer-api.mdx) is initially indexed using custom processors.
Each core processor indexes a specific type of data.
You can explore the [full list of processors](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processors/tree/main/rust/sdk-processor/src/processors) and the [complete indexer data schema](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processors/blob/main/rust/processor/src/db/postgres/schema.rs).

The Aptos core processors and the [Quickstart Guide](../quickstart.mdx) use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database and [Diesel](https://diesel.rs/) as the ORM.
If you'd also like to use PostgreSQL and Diesel, you can follow the instructions in [PostgreSQL Installation](../quickstart.mdx#postgresql-installation).

You're free to use whatever database and ORM you prefer.
Popular alternatives include [SeaORM](https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaORM/) and [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx). 
If you need guidance, refer to the tutorials linked above for more information.
