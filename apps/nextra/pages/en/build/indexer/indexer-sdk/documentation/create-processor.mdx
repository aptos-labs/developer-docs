# Creating a Processor

This guide will walk you through setting up the basic template for a new processor.

## Pre-requisites
You've already set up your environment and have the Indexer SDK `aptos-indexer-sdk` and `aptos-indexer-sdk-server-framework` installed. 
If you haven't, follow the [Indexer SDK installation guide](./setup.mdx).

## Overview
Creating and running a processor will require several pieces: 
1. `IndexerProcessorConfig`
2. `ProcessorConfig`
3. The processor itself. This is where you'll define a processor's config, the processor setup, and the steps that will be run to index transactions. 
4. `main.rs` - The main file that will run the processor.

The next section goes through each of these pieces more explicitly and provides code examples. 

## How to define `IndexerProcessorConfig`
The `IndexerProcessorConfig` defines the base configuration for all processors that you'll be running.
It should include configuration for things that are shared across multiple processors, like the database configuration and [Transaction Stream](../../txn-stream.mdx) configuration.

[`ServerArgs`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processors-sdk/sdk-server-framework/src/lib.rs#L26) parses a `config.yaml` file and bootstraps a server with all the common pieces to run a processor.

To setup the configuration for your processor and make it work with `ServerArgs`, you'll need to define a `IndexerProcessorConfig` that implements the [`RunnableConfig`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processors-sdk/sdk-server-framework/src/lib.rs#L102) trait.
It also triggers a run method, which can be invoked in `main.rs`.

For basic cases, you can copy the [`IndexerProcessorConfig` from the `aptos-indexer-processor-example`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-example/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processor-example/src/config/indexer_processor_config.rs) repository and modify it to fit your needs.

## How to define `ProcessorConfig`
`ProcessorConfig` is an enum that contains all the individual processor configs.
It's used by `IndexerProcessorConfig.run()` to map the processor name to the right `ProcessorConfig`. 

You can see a basic example of a `ProcessorConfig` [here](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-example/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processor-example/src/config/processor_config.rs). 
An example of a more complex setup that includes multiple processors and configurations is [`aptos-indexer-processors`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processors/blob/main/rust/sdk-processor/src/config/processor_config.rs#L84).

## How to create a processor
Now that you've got the configuration pieces set up, the next step is to create the processor. 
The processor is represented by a struct and is usually named `{PROCESSOR_NAME}Processor`, like `EventsProcessor` or `TokenV2Processor`, depending on the type of data it's indexing.
```rust
pub struct EventsProcessor {
    pub config: IndexerProcessorConfig,
    pub db_pool: ArcDbPool,
}
```
The processor's constructor should be defined like so:
```rust
pub async fn new(config: IndexerProcessorConfig) -> Result<Self> {
    // Processor setup code here, if needed
}
```
It takes in the `IndexerProcessorConfig` that you've defined and performs any setup required to instantiate the processor. 
Next, your processor needs to implement the [`ProcessorTrait`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk/blob/a56b641a6aaca60092fcc9bbd98252f3cd703299/aptos-indexer-processors-sdk/sdk/src/traits/processor_trait.rs#L4).
```rust
#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl ProcessorTrait for EventsProcessor {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str {
        self.config.processor_config.name()
    }

    async fn run_processor(&self) -> Result<()> {
        // Processor logic here
    }
}
```
The `run_processor` method is the most important method in the processor. 

If you're using a migration-based database, like PostgreSQL, running the migrations can go inside of `run_processor`.
This is also where we implement logic to determine the appropriate starting version for the processor, verify the chain ID using [Transaction Stream](../../txn-stream.mdx), and validate the processor's configuration. 

`run_processor` also contains the instantiation of the processor's `Step`s and the specification of how these `Step`s are connected together by channels.

```rust
// Instantiate processor steps
let transaction_stream = TransactionStreamStep::new(TransactionStreamConfig {
    starting_version: Some(starting_version),
    ..self.config.transaction_stream_config.clone()
})
.await?;
// ... Instantiate the rest of your processor's steps ...

// Connect processor steps
let (_, buffer_receiver) = ProcessorBuilder::new_with_inputless_first_step(
    transaction_stream.into_runnable_step(),
)
.connect_to(extractor_step.into_runnable_step(), channel_size)
.connect_to(storer_step.into_runnable_step(), channel_size)
.connect_to(version_tracker_step.into_runnable_step(), channel_size)
.end_and_return_output_receiver(channel_size);

// Read the results from the output of the last step
loop {
    match buffer_receiver.recv().await {
        // Do something with th output
    }
}
```

You can see a full example of a processor that indexes raw Aptos events in [`aptos-indexer-processor-example`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-example/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processor-example/src/processors/events/events_processor.rs). 
As a reference, you can also see all of the processors that make up the [Indexer API](../../indexer-api.mdx) in [`aptos-indexer-processors`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processors/tree/main/rust/sdk-processor/src/processors).

## How to define `main.rs`
You may copy the [`main.rs`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-example/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processor-example/src/main.rs) file from the `aptos-indexer-processor-example`. 

These lines of code uses the `ServerArgs` and the `IndexerProcessorConfig` that we've defined earlier: 
```rust
let args = ServerArgs::parse();
args.run::<IndexerProcessorConfig>(tokio::runtime::Handle::current())
    .await
```
