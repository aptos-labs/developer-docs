# Creating a Step

## What is a step?
A step is a unit of processing logic in the SDK and can be used to define logic for the extraction, transformation, or storing of data. 
Steps are the building blocks of a processor.
The Aptos core processors represent (1) getting a stream of transactions from [Transaction Stream](../../txn-stream.mdx), (2) extracting the data, (3) writing to a database, and (4) tracking the progress, each as separate steps.  

There are two types of steps in the SDK:
1. **AsyncStep**: Processes a batch of input items and returns a batch of output items.
2. **PollableAsyncStep**: Does the same as `AsyncStep`, but it also periodically polls its internal state and returns a batch of output items if available.

## How to create a Step
To create a step with the SDK, follow these instructions:

1. Implement the `Processable` trait. This trait defines several important details about the step: the input and output types, the processing logic, and the run type (either `AsyncStepRunType` or `PollableAsyncStepRunType`).
    
    ```rust
    #[async_trait]
    impl Processable for MyExtractorStep {
        // The Input is a vec of Transaction 
        type Input = Vec<Transaction>;
        // The Output is a vec of MyData
        type Output = Vec<MyData>;

        // Depending on the type of step this is, the RunType is either
        // - AsyncRunType
        // - PollableAsyncRunType
        type RunType = AsyncRunType;
    
    	// Processes a batch of input items and returns a batch of output items.
        async fn process(
            &mut self,
            input: TransactionContext<Vec<Transaction>>,
        ) -> Result<Option<TransactionContext<Vec<MyData>>>, ProcessorError> {
            let transactions = input.data;
            let data = transactions.iter().map(|transaction| {
                // Define the processing logic to extract MyData from a Transaction
            }).collect();
            
            Ok(Some(TransactionContext {
                data,
                metadata: input.metadata,
            }))
        }
    }
    ```

    
    <Callout type="info">
        In most cases, you're going to be processing a list of inputs to a list of outputs.
        To speed up the processing, we recommend using [`rayon`](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/) to process sequential computations in parallel.
        You can see an example of how we use [`rayon.par_iter`](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/#basic-usage-and-the-rayon-prelude) to parallelize the processing [here](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-example/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processor-example/src/processors/events/events_extractor.rs#L30).
    </Callout>

    In the example code above, you'll notice that the input and output types are wrapped within a `TransactionContext`.
    `TransactionContext` contains relevant metadata about the batch of data being processed, such as the transaction versions and timestamp, and are used for metrics and logging. 
    
2. Implement the `NamedStep` trait. This is used for logging.
    
    ```rust
    impl NamedStep for MyExtractorStep {
        fn name(&self) -> String {
            "MyExtractorStep".to_string()
        }
    }
    ```
    
3. Implement either `AsyncStep` trait or `PollableAsyncStep` trait, which defines how the step will be run in the processor.
    1. If you're using `AsyncStep`, add this to your code:
        
        ```rust        
        impl AsyncStep for MyExtractorStep {}
        ```
        
    2. If you're creating a `PollableAsyncStep`, you will need to define the poll interval and what the step should do every time it polls.
        
        ```rust        
        #[async_trait]
        impl<T: Send + 'static> PollableAsyncStep for MyPollStep<T>
        where
            Self: Sized + Send + Sync + 'static,
            T: Send + 'static,
        {
            fn poll_interval(&self) -> std::time::Duration {
                // Define duration
            }
        
            async fn poll(&mut self) -> Result<Option<Vec<TransactionContext<T>>>, ProcessorError> {
                // Define code here on what this step should do every time it polls
                // Optionally return a batch of output items
            }
        }
        ```

## Parsing Transactions
When building the extractor step, you'll need to define how you want to parse your data from transactions. 
Read more about how to parse your data from transactions [here](./steps/parsing-txns.mdx).

## Common SDK steps

The SDK comes with a set of [common steps](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk/tree/main/aptos-indexer-processors-sdk/sdk/src/common_steps) that you can use to build your processor.

1. `TransactionStreamStep` provides a stream of Aptos transactions to the processor. Read more about it [here](./steps/transaction-stream.mdx).
2. `TimedBufferStep` buffers a batch of items and periodically polls to release the items to the next step
3. `VersionTrackerStep` tracks the progress of the processor and checkpoints the processor's progress. Read more about it [here](./version-tracking.mdx).
4. `OrderByVersionStep` orders transaction contextx by their starting versions. It buffers ordered these contexts and releases them at every poll interval.
5. `WriteRateLimitStep` limits the number of bytes written to the database per second.
