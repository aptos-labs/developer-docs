# Creating a Step

## What is a step?
A step is a unit of processing logic in the SDK and can be used to define logic for the extraction, transformation, or storing of data. Steps are the building blocks of a processor.

There are two types of steps in the SDK:
1. **AsyncStep**: Processes a batch of input items and returns a batch of output items.
2. **PollableAsyncStep**: Does the same as `AsyncStep`, but it also periodically polls its internal state and returns a batch of output items if available.

## How to create a Step
To create a step with the SDK, follow these instructions:

1. Implement the `Processable` trait. This trait defines several important details about the step: the input and output types, the processing logic, and the run type (either `AsyncStepRunType` or `PollableAsyncStepRunType`).
    
    ```rust
    #[async_trait]
    impl Processable for MyExtractorStep {
        // The Input is a batch of Transaction 
        type Input = Transaction;
        // The Output is a batch of MyData
        type Output = MyData;

        // Depending on the type of step this is, the RunType is either
        // - AsyncRunType
        // - PollableAsyncRunType
        type RunType = AsyncRunType;
    
    	// Processes a batch of input items and returns a batch of output items.
        async fn process(
            &mut self,
            input: TransactionContext<Transaction>,
        ) -> Result<Option<TransactionContext<MyData>>, ProcessorError> {
            let transactions = input.data;
            let data = transactions.iter().map(|transaction| {
                // Define the processing logic to extract MyData from a Transaction
            }).collect();
            
            Ok(Some(TransactionContext {
            data,
            metadata: input.metadata,
            }))
        }
    }
    ```

    In the example code above, you'll notice that the input and output types are wrapped within a `TransactionContext`.
    `TransactionContext` contains relevant metadata about the batch of data being processed, such as the transaction versions and timestamp, and are used for metrics and logging. 
    
2. Implement the `NamedStep` trait. This is used for logging.
    
    ```rust
    impl NamedStep for MyExtractorStep {
        fn name(&self) -> String {
            "MyExtractorStep".to_string()
        }
    }
    ```
    
3. Implement either `AsyncStep` trait or `PollableAsyncStep` trait, which defines how the step will be run in the processor.
    1. If you're using `AsyncStep`, add this to your code:
        
        ```rust        
        impl AsyncStep for MyExtractorStep {}
        ```
        
    2. If you're creating a `PollableAsyncStep`, you will need to define the poll interval and what the step should do every time it polls.
        
        ```rust        
        #[async_trait]
        impl<T: Send + 'static> PollableAsyncStep for MyPollStep<T>
        where
            Self: Sized + Send + Sync + 'static,
            T: Send + 'static,
        {
            fn poll_interval(&self) -> std::time::Duration {
                // Define duration
            }
        
            async fn poll(&mut self) -> Result<Option<Vec<TransactionContext<T>>>, ProcessorError> {
                // Define code here on what this step should do every time it polls
                // Optionally return a batch of output items
            }
        }
        ```

## How to connect steps

Now that you have created a step, you can connect it to other steps in the processor. 
`ProcessorBuilder` is used to connect a graph of steps to construct a processor. 
It uses trait bounds to ensure that the output type of each step matches the input type of its connected step. 

### How to use `ProcessorBuilder`

1. Initialize the processor with the first step using `ProcessorBuilder::new_with_inputless_first_step`. 
2. Connect the next step using `.connect_to(second_step.into_runnable_step(), channel_size)`. 
- `.into_runnable_step()` converts your step into a `RunnableStep`, which enables it to store the step's input and output channels and allows the step to be spawned in a task. 
- When you use `.connect_to`, a channel gets created with size `channel_size` and connected to the previous and current steps, and the previous step is spawned in a task. 
3. To close off the `ProcessorBuilder`, use `.end_and_return_output_receiver(channel_size)`. This returns a channel receiver that can be used to receive the final output of the processor.

### Example
```rust
let (pb, buffer_receiver) = ProcessorBuilder::new_with_inputless_first_step(
      first_step.into_runnable_step(),
  )
  .connect_to(second_step.into_runnable_step(), channel_size)
  .connect_to(third_step.into_runnable_step(), channel_size)
  .end_and_return_output_receiver(channel_size);
```

## Common steps

The SDK provides several common steps that you can use in your processor. 

1. `TransactionStreamStep` provides a stream of Aptos transactions to the processor
2. `TimedBufferStep` buffers a batch of items and periodically polls to release the items to the next step
