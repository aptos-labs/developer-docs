# Version Tracking, Restart Behavior, and Backfilling

## Version Tracking
The `VersionTrackerStep` is a [common step in the SDK](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processors-v2/blob/main/processor/src/processors/events/events_processor.rs#L125) method as other steps.  Upon a successfully processed batch, the `VersionTrackerStep` will [call](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processors-sdk/sdk/src/common_steps/version_tracker_step.rs#L57) the trait implementation of `save_processor_status()`.

### ProcessorStatusSaver
The `ProcessorStatusSaver` trait requires the implementation of the method `save_processor_status` with the following signature:

```rust
async fn save_processor_status(
        &self,
        last_success_batch: &TransactionContext<()>,
    ) -> Result<(), ProcessorError>;
```
This method is where checkpointing should be written. 
If you're writing to Postgres, you can use the SDK's Postgres implementation [here](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processors-sdk/sdk/src/postgres/utils/checkpoint.rs#L66). 
It is possible to checkpoint progress in different ways by using enums. 
The SDK's Postgres implementation inserts using a simple [`processor_status` model](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processors-sdk/sdk/src/postgres/models/processor_status.rs). 


## Restart Behavior 
Now that the processor successfully writes to the chosen store for version tracking, upon restarting it needs to retrieve the latest successful version from that store. 
[Here is an example](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processors-sdk/sdk/src/postgres/utils/checkpoint.rs#L118) of a `get_starting_version()` method that returns the latest processed version saved. 
This `starting_version: u64` can then be used as below. 
If there is no checkpoint, the processor will start from the beginning of the chain.

```rust
 let transaction_stream = TransactionStreamStep::new(TransactionStreamConfig {
            starting_version: Some(starting_version),
            ..self.config.transaction_stream_config.clone()
        })
        .await?;
```


## Backfilling
The SDK does not provide an implementation of `ProcessorStatusSaver` that will save backfill progress.
 To enable saving backfill progress, `IndexerProcessorConfig`, `ProcessorStatusSaver` and `get_starting_version()` need some updates.
Without these changes, it is difficult to run a live processor at the latest transaction version as well as a backfill processor. 

### Updates to Config
[Add an additional field](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processors-v2/blob/main/processor/src/config/processor_mode.rs#L29) on your `IndexerProcessorConfig` for a `BackfillConfig`.
In this implementation, the `BackfillConfig` is part of an enum `ProcessorMode` that is used to determine the mode the processor is running in.
In backfill mode, the processor starts from a different version and the progress is saved in a separate table. 

### Updates to `config.yaml`
Add the `backfill_config` section to `server_config` in your yaml file to set `backfill_alias`. [Example](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processors-v2/blob/main/processor/example-backfill-config.yaml)

### Backfill Processor Status Table
Use a separate table for backfill processor status to avoid write conflicts. This table (`backfill_processor_status_table`) uses `backfill_alias` as the primary key instead of `processor_name` to prevent conflicts with the main `processor_status` table when running head and backfill processors concurrently. 
Create multiple backfill processors with differing `backfill_alias` and transaction version ranges for a faster backfill.
Expand on this [implementation](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processors-v2/blob/main/processor/src/db/backfill_processor_status.rs). 
This model introduces a new state, `BackfillStatus`, which is either `InProgress` or `Complete` which will determine the backfilling restart behavior.

### Updates to ProcessorStatusSaver
Expand your `ProcessorStatusSaver` implementation to include a `Backfill` variant that extracts the `backfill_alias` from the `BackfillConfig`, and the `backfill_start_version` `backfill_end_version` from `IndexerProcessorConfig.transaction_stream_config` [like this](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processors-v2/blob/main/processor/src/processors/processor_status_saver.rs#L96). 
Update the corresponding write query to write to the new `backfill_processor_status` table.

### Updates to get_starting_version
Add a [statement](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processors-v2/blob/main/processor/src/processors/processor_status_saver.rs#L190) in your `get_starting_version` method to query the `backfill_processor_status_table` when the `BackfillConfig` field is present in `IndexerProcessorConfig` .
