# Initial Setup

If you're creating a custom processor from scratch, we recommend following the [Quickstart Guide](../quickstart.mdx).

If you're looking to use the Indexer SDK in an existing Rust project, follow the steps below.

The Indexer SDK provides several Rust crates:
1. `aptos-indexer-processor-sdk` - The core SDK that provides the building blocks for creating a processor.
2. `aptos-indexer-processor-sdk-server-framework` - A server framework for creating a server that runs the processor and includes health checks and metrics logging probes.
3. `aptos-indexer-testing-framework` - An e2e testing framework for testing processors.

Depending on what you need, you can choose to include one or more of these crates in your project.

To your `Cargo.toml`, add

```yaml
aptos-indexer-processor-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk.git", rev = "aptos-indexer-processor-sdk-v1.0.0" }
aptos-indexer-processor-sdk-server-framework = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk.git", rev = "aptos-indexer-processor-sdk-v1.0.0" }
aptos-indexer-testing-framework = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk.git", rev = "aptos-indexer-processor-sdk-v1.0.0" }
```
