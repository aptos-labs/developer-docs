# Initial Setup

If you're creating a custom processor from scratch, we recommend following the [Quickstart Guide](../quickstart.mdx).
The quickstart guide provides a template processor and includes all of this setup.

If you're migrating an existing processor to the Indexer SDK, follow the steps below.

Add `aptos-indexer-processor-sdk` to your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
aptos-indexer-processor-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk.git", rev = "aptos-indexer-processor-sdk-v1.0.0" }
```

`aptos-indexer-processor-sdk` includes the following features:
1. `postgres_full` - Interface layer to integrate Postgres with your processor.
2. `testing_framework` - An e2e testing framework for testing processors. If you want to write tests for your processor, add this feature to the crate.
