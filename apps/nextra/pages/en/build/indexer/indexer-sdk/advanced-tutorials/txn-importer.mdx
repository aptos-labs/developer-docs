title: "Aptos Transaction Import"

## Overview

This guide explains how to import Aptos transactions for testing using the `aptos-indexer-transaction-generator` tool. These test transactions can be used to test your custom processors and support their local development. 

## General Flow of Transaction Importing

First, identify the transaction versions you need to fetch from the Aptos network. This tool interacts with the [Transaction Stream](https://aptos.dev/en/build/indexer/txn-stream) to retrieve transaction data in JSON format. The transactions are then consolidated into a Rust file, where each transaction is represented as a constant variable. These constants can be seamlessly used as mocked inputs in processor automated tests. During testing, the processor fetches the specified transactions, processes them, and writes the results to a database. You can then verify the outcomes by loading the written data and validating it against the expected data.

## Prerequisites

1. A valid API key to connect to [Transaction Stream](https://aptos.dev/en/build/indexer/txn-stream/aptos-hosted-txn-stream)
2. Clone the [aptos-core](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core) repository:
    - Navigate to the `aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator` directory.

## How to Import Test Transactions

### 1. Specify Versions to Import

Locate and make a copy of the file:

```bash
ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator/imported_transactions/imported_transactions.yaml
```

In this file, specify the versions to import from Devnet|Testnet|Mainnet by configuring the appropriate endpoint, API key, and mapping version numbers to descriptive output names. An example configuration is shown below:

```yaml
testnet:
  transaction_stream_endpoint: https://grpc.testnet.aptoslabs.com:443
  api_key: TESTNET_API_KEY  # <--- Replace this with your API key to generate files locally
  versions_to_import:
    # Replace these with the versions you want to import
    1: 1_genesis
    2: 2_new_block_event
    3: 3_empty_txn
    278556781: 278556781_v1_coin_register_fa_metadata
    1255836496: 1255836496_v2_fa_metadata
    5979639459: 5979639459_coin_register
    5992795934: 5992795934_fa_activities
    5523474016: 5523474016_validator_txn

mainnet:
  transaction_stream_endpoint: https://grpc.mainnet.aptoslabs.com:443
  api_key: MAINNET_API_KEY
  versions_to_import:
    308783012: 308783012_fa_transfer
```

### 2. Run the Command to Import Transactions

Navigate to the `indexer-transaction-generator` directory:

```bash
cd aptos-core/ecosystem/indexer-grpc/indexer-transaction-generator
```

To import the specified transaction versions, execute the following command:

```bash
cargo run -- --testing-folder  /path/to/your/imported_transactions.yaml --output-folder /path/to/your/processor-repo/src
```

This command will:

1. Read the configuration from the `imported_transactions.yaml` file located in the folder specified by the --testing-folder flag.
2. Fetch the specified transaction versions from the selected network (Devnet, Testnet or Mainnet).
3. Store the resulting JSON files in the specified output folder (/path/to/your/processor-repo/src/json_transactions).
4. Generate a Rust file (`generated_transactions.rs`) that converts the generated transaction JSON files into constant variables for use in tests.

Note: Replace /path/to/your/processor-repo with the path to your processor repository or preferred storage location.

**Explanation of Command Flags**
1. `--testing-folder`
What is the --testing-folder flag?
The --testing-folder flag specifies the directory containing the imported_transactions.yaml configuration file. The tool uses this folder to read versions you wish to import.
 - Ensure the folder path matches the location of your imported_transactions.yaml file.
 - By default, this guide assumes the configuration is stored in ./imported_transactions. Adjust the flag value if you place the file elsewhere.

2. `--output-folder`
Specifies the destination directory where the generated transaction JSON files and Rust constants will be saved.
 - Replace /path/to/your/processor-repo with your processor repository src directory or desired storage location.
 - Ensure this folder is part of your version control setup if these files need to be shared.

## How to Use the Testing Transactions

### Export the Generated File

Update the `mod.rs` file to include the generated Rust file containing the transaction constants. If `mod.rs` doesnâ€™t exist, create one in the target folder:

[Reference mod.rs](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-example/blob/main/test-transactions-example/src/json_transactions/mod.rs).

### Export the `json_transactions` Folder

Since the `generated_transactions.rs` reles on the `json_transactions` Ensure the `json_transactions` folder is properly exported in the library file for your tests have direct access to the transaction data.

[Reference lib.rs](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-example/blob/main/test-transactions-example/src/lib.rs).

### Integrate into Test Cases

Use the exported transaction constants directly in your test cases to simulate real transactions and validate processing logic.

[Example Crate](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-example/tree/main/test-transactions-example).

## Next Steps
Once the transaction constants are integrated, you can use them in processor tests to validate functionality. For detailed instructions on writing processor tests, refer to Writing Processor Tests.
