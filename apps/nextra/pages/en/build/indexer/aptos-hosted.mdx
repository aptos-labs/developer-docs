# Indexer API Access

import { IndexerBetaNotice, Card, Cards } from '@components/index';

<IndexerBetaNotice />

Aptos Labs hosts a public version of the Indexer GraphQL API that anyone can use to get historical, aggregate, or custom data from on-chain. 

You can explore it by hand by viewing the Hasura Explorer below for the network you are interested in.

You can also access the API via the GraphQL endpoints below. For more information on the format of data in each field / table, please see the [table reference page](indexer-reference.mdx).

## Hasura Explorer (Manual Queries)

Choose a network to explore the free Aptos-Hosted Indexer API using the Hasura Explorer:

## GraphQL API Endpoints

The primary way to use the Indexer is to access it through the [TypeScript SDK](../sdks/ts-sdk/fetch-data-via-sdk.mdx).

If you need to directly make GraphQL queries to the Aptos-Labs hosted Indexer API, then use the following endpoints: When making GraphQL queries to the Aptos-Hosted Indexer API, use the following endpoints:

- **Mainnet:** `https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/graphql`
- **Testnet:** `https://api.testnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/graphql`
- **Devnet:** `https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/graphql`

### Rate limits

The following rate limit applies for the Aptos Labs hosted indexer API:

- For a web application that calls this Aptos-provided indexer API directly from the client (for example, wallet or explorer), the rate limit is currently 5000 requests per five minutes by IP address. **Note that this limit can change with or without prior notice.**

If you need a higher rate limit, consider the following solutions:

1. Get an API Key from [API Gateway](https://developers.aptoslabs.com/).
2. Run the Aptos Indexer API yourself. See the guide to self-hosting [here](api/self-hosted.mdx).
