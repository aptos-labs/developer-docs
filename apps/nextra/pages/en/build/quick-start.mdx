A quick start by asking questions that describe what you are looking for.

{ /* TODO add highlights before the rest */ }
## What would you like to learn?

{/* TODO: Do we go more in depth? */}

Let's start by choosing which question you're asking

* [Looking for how to write Smart Contracts?](#looking-for-how-to-write-smart-contracts)
* [Looking for how to connect your app to the Blockchain?](#looking-for-how-to-connect-your-app-to-the-blockchain)
* [Looking to learn more about the Aptos Blockchain?](#looking-to-learn-more-about-the-aptos-blockchain)

* [Not sure what I am looking for?](#not-sure-what-i-am-looking-for)

## Looking for how to write Smart Contracts?

We provide three ways to learn Move, the Smart Contract language.  You can learn
by tutorials, examples, or by reference documentation.

### Learn by Interactive Tutorials

Learn Move with interactive tutorials from these

- Basic and advanced tutorials on [Aptos Learn](https://learn.aptoslabs.com/tutorials)
- Learn about Move with a friendly spider mascot by [Move Spiders](https://movespiders.com)
- Have fun learning Move with [Aptos Shores](https://www.aptosshores.com)

### Learn by Examples

Check out some examples of code in the Move language to learn how common tasks
can be done in Move!

- Some Move examples on [Aptos Learn](https://learn.aptoslabs.com/examples)
- A set of Move examples in the [Aptos core move examples](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/main/aptos-move/move-examples)


### Learn by Reference Documentation

Check out these more involved docs to learn how to code in Move:

- [Learn via the Move Book](smart-contracts/learn-move/book.mdx)
- [Learn more details on Move on Aptos](smart-contracts.mdx)
- [Learn about the Move Prover](smart-contracts/learn-move/prover.mdx)

## Looking for how to connect your app to the Blockchain?

We provide documentation around three main areas for applications.  How to build
an app on Aptos, how to integrate your wallet with the blockchain (and apps),
and how to integrate your existing app to the blockchain.

### Build your app

{/* TODO add the e2e dapp tutorial? /*}
- Language specific [SDK documentation](sdks.mdx)
- Interactive [Aptos CLI](cli.mdx) for compiling contracts and interacting with the blockchain
- Learn about the [Node APIs](apis.mdx) and how they interact with the blockchain
- Learn about [indexing](indexer.mdx) and how it can help your application scale
- Learn about [standards on the Aptos blockchain](smart-contracts/aptos-standards.mdx)
- Learn about how to [develop locally with a localnet](cli/use-cli/running-a-local-network.mdx)

### Build your wallet

{/* TODO add new wallet standards */}
- Learn about the [wallet adapter](sdks/wallet-adapter.mdx)

### Integrate your existing app

{/* TODO add more in depth / better guides */}
- Learn about [integrating your existing application directly](advanced-guides/system-integrators-guide.mdx)

## Looking to learn more about the Aptos blockchain?

Here are some documents on concepts and how the blockchain works:

- Start with [learning about aptos](../network/blockchain.mdx)
- Read the [Aptos white paper](../network/blockchain/aptos-white-paper.mdx)

## Looking on how to set up a full node or validator?

Here are two sections on how to run and troubleshoot nodes:

- [Setup a full node](../network/nodes/full-node.mdx)
- [Setup a validator](../network/nodes/validator-node.mdx)

## Not sure what I am looking for?

If you're not sure what you're looking for, feel free to:
- [Submit your first transaction](https://learn.aptoslabs.com/my-first-series/transaction)
- Start with [learning about aptos](../network/blockchain.mdx)
- Try some other basic tutorials on [Aptos Learn](https://learn.aptoslabs.com/tutorials)
