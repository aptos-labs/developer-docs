# Aptos Fullnode REST API

This API - embedded into Fullnodes - provides a simple, low latency, yet low-level way of reading state and submitting transactions to the Aptos Blockchain. It also supports transaction simulation.
For more advanced queries, we recommend using the [Indexer GraphQL API](../indexer.mdx).

## Understanding rate limits

As with the [Aptos Indexer](../indexer/indexer-api.mdx), the Aptos REST API has a rate limit of 5000
requests per five minutes by IP address, whether submitting transactions or querying the API on Aptos-provided nodes.
(As a node operator, you may raise those limits on your own node.) Note that this limit can change with or without prior
notice.

## Viewing current and historical state

Most integrations into the Aptos blockchain benefit from a holistic and comprehensive overview of the current and
historical state of the blockchain. Aptos provides historical transactions, state, and events, all the result of
transaction execution.

- Historical transactions specify the execution status, output, and tie to related events. Each transaction has a unique
version number associated with it that dictates its global sequential ordering in the history of the blockchain ledger.
- The state is the representation of all transaction outputs up to a specific version. In other words, a state version
is the accumulation of all transactions inclusive of that transaction version.
- As transactions execute, they may emit events. [Events](../../network/blockchain/events.mdx) are hints about changes in on-chain
data.

<Callout type="info">
Ensure the [fullnode](../../network/nodes/networks.mdx) you are communicating with is up-to-date. The fullnode must reach the
version containing your transaction to retrieve relevant data from it. There can be latency from the fullnodes
retrieving state from [validator fullnodes](../../network/blockchain/fullnodes.mdx), which in turn rely upon
[validator nodes](../../network/blockchain/validator-nodes.mdx) as the source of truth.
</Callout>

The storage service on a node employs two forms of pruning that erase data from nodes:

- state
- events, transactions, and everything else

While either of these may be disabled, storing the state versions is not particularly sustainable.

Events and transactions pruning can be disabled via setting the [`enable_ledger_pruner`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/cf0bc2e4031a843cdc0c04e70b3f7cd92666afcf/config/src/config/storage_config.rs#L141)
to `false` in `storage_config.rs`. This is default behavior in Mainnet. In the near future, Aptos will provide indexers
 that mitigate the need to directly query from a node.

The REST API offers querying transactions and events in these ways:

- [Transactions for an account](https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/operations/get_account_transactions)
- [Transactions by version](https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/operations/get_transaction_by_version)
- [Events by event handle](https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/spec#/operations/get_events_by_event_handle)

## Reading state with the View function

View functions do not modify blockchain state when called from the API. A [View function](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/api/src/view_function.rs)
 and its [input](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/api/types/src/view.rs) can be used to read
 potentially complex on-chain state using Move. For example, you can evaluate who has the highest bid in an auction
 contract. Here are related files:

- [`view_function.rs`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/api/src/tests/view_function.rs) for an example
- related [Move](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/90c33dc7a18662839cd50f3b70baece0e2dbfc71/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/coin.move#L226) code
- [specification](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/90c33dc7a18662839cd50f3b70baece0e2dbfc71/api/doc/spec.yaml#L8513).

The view function operates like the Aptos simulation API,
though with no side effects and an accessible output path. View functions can be called via the `/view` endpoint. Calls
to view functions require the module and function names along with input type parameters and values.

A function does not have to be immutable to be tagged as `#[view]`, but if the function is mutable it will not result in
state mutation when called from the API. If you want to tag a mutable function as `#[view]`, consider making it private
so that it cannot be maliciously called during runtime.

In order to use the View functions, you need to [publish the module](../cli/working-with-move-contracts.mdx)
through the [Aptos CLI](../cli.mdx).

In the Aptos CLI, a view function request would look like this:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos move view --function-id devnet::message::get_message --profile devnet --args address:devnet
{
  "Result": [
    "View functions rock!"
  ]
}
```

In the TypeScript SDK, a view function request would look like this:

```ts filename="index.ts"
import { Aptos } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";

const aptos = new Aptos();
const [balance] = aptos.view<[string]>({
  function: "0x1::coin::balance",
  typeArguments: ["0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin"],
  functionArguments: [alice.accountAddress]
});

expect(balance).toBe("100000000");
```

The view function returns a list of values as a vector. By default, the results are returned in JSON format; however,
they can be optionally returned in Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS) encoded format.
