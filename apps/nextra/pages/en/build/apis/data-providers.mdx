# Data Providers

If you want to access aptos blockchain data but don't need it in real-time.
We have a few options that will let you access this data using SQL or UIs for building dashboards.
This type of data is often used for analytics since it allows for aggregations.

## Review of data endpoints

Hitting the full node directly will give the latest data (will be missing historical unless it's an archival full node) using [REST API](../apis.mdx#aptos-fullnode)

Indexer layer on top of this will provide a [GRPC transaction stream](../indexer/txn-stream/aptos-hosted-txn-stream)

On top of this transaction stream, we've built out some product logic tables that can be queried through [GraphQL](../indexer/)

Since the logic to parse out transaction is [public](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processors), some vendors have implemented similar parsing logic to create a subset of tables and made them available to query.

## SQL Tables

Indexer defines several processors that create different database tables.

### Core tables

These are parsed directly from node API response, one option is to split it out into the following tables:

- Blocks - version, block height, epoch, timestamp
- Transactions - version, sender, entry function, gas
- Signatures - signature types, signer, fee payer address
- Events - type and data for events

We store data as table items, resources or modules

- (write set) changes - change index, change type, resource address
- Table items - table key, table handle, key (content and type), value (content and type)
- (move) resources - resource address, resource type, data
- (move) modules - bytecode for deployed modules

## Vendors of off-chain data

Most of our data vendors only provide core datasets.
A [subset of vendors](https://aptosfoundation.org/currents/aptos-on-chain-data-capabilities-with-dune-nansen-and-other-providers) is listed below

### Google bigquery public dataset

Provides data through [google public data](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/crypto-aptos-mainnet-us)

We also have sample analytics queries [using the above resources](https://github.com/aptos-labs/explorer/tree/main/analytics)

### Dune

We have a dashboard here: https://dune.com/aptos/aptos-chain-metrics-overview

### Flipside

Another dashboard vendor, signatures in core tables were merged into `fact_transactions`
They also have a few more convenience tables (defi, nft, price), [table list](https://flipsidecrypto.github.io/aptos-models/#!/overview)

### Artemis 

Provides [topline metrics](https://app.artemis.xyz/project/aptos) as well as chart builder

### Nansen

Provides [topline metrics](https://app.nansen.ai/macro/blockchains?chain=aptos) with additional functionality with account.

### Allium

Raw data is available: https://docs.allium.so/historical-data/supported-blockchains/move-ecosystem/aptos

### Sentio

They have a guide here: https://docs.sentio.xyz/docs/aptos
Data is found in data source -> external project  -> sentio/aptos-overview
They also provide stack tracing of transactions

### Space and Time

Data can be found here: https://app.spaceandtime.ai/data-sets?selectedChain=aptos
They also have some non-core tables (Token, Staking, etc)

## Other vendors

We also have some partners who target more enterprise use cases
