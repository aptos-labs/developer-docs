# Faucet API

The faucet allows users to get test `APT` coins on Devnet and Testnet. It is not available on Mainnet.

## Differences between devnet and testnet

What are the differences between devnet and testnet? Effectively none. In the
past, the testnet faucet had a Captcha in front of it, making it unqueryable
by
normal means. This is no longer true.

The endpoints for each faucet are:

- Devnet: https://faucet.devnet.aptoslabs.com
- Testnet: https://faucet.testnet.aptoslabs.com

## Integrating with the faucet

See the [System Integrators Guide](../guides/system-integrators-guide.mdx) for more information on how to use the faucet with your project.

### Calling the faucet via Terminal

If you are trying to call the faucet in other languages, you have two options:

1. Generate a client from
the [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/crates/aptos-faucet/doc/spec.yaml).
2. Call the faucet on your own.

For the latter, you will want to build a query similar to this:

```bash filename="Terminal"
curl -X POST
'https://faucet.devnet.aptoslabs.com/mint?amount=10000&address=0xd0f523c9e73e6f3d68c16ae883a9febc616e484c4998a72d8899a1009e5a89d6'
```

This means mint 10000 OCTA to
address `0xd0f523c9e73e6f3d68c16ae883a9febc616e484c4998a72d8899a1009e5a89d6`.


### Calling the faucet: JavaScript / TypeScript

If you are building a client in JavaScript or TypeScript, you should make use
of the [@aptos-labs/aptos-faucet-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aptos-labs/aptos-faucet-client)
package. This client is generated based on the OpenAPI spec published by the
faucet service.

Example use:

```ts filename="index.ts"
import {
  AptosFaucetClient,
  FundRequest,
} from "@aptos-labs/aptos-faucet-client";

async function callFaucet(amount: number, address: string): Promise<string []> {
  const faucetClient = new AptosFaucetClient({
    BASE: "https://faucet.devnet.aptoslabs.com",
  });
  const request: FundRequest = {
    amount,
    address,
  };
  const response = await faucetClient.fund({ requestBody: request });
  return response.txn_hashes;
}
```
