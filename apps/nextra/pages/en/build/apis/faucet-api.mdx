# Faucet API

The faucet allows users to get test `APT` on Devnet and Testnet. It is not available on Mainnet.

The endpoints for each faucet are:

- Devnet: https://faucet.devnet.aptoslabs.com
- Testnet: https://faucet.testnet.aptoslabs.com

## Using the faucet

Each SDK has integration for devnet and testnet to use the faucet. Below are a few examples, but you can
see more information on each individual [SDK's documentation](../sdks.mdx).

### Using the faucet in a wallet

Most wallets, such as [Petra](https://aptosfoundation.org/ecosystem/project/petra) or [Pontem](https://aptosfoundation.org/ecosystem/project/pontem-wallet)
will have a faucet button for devnet and testnet. See full list of [Aptos Wallets](https://aptosfoundation.org/ecosystem/projects/wallets).

### Using the faucet in the Aptos CLI

Once you've [set up your CLI](../cli/setup-cli.mdx), you can simply call fund-with-faucet.  The amount used is in Octas (1 APT = 1,000,000,000 Octas).

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos account fund-with-faucet --account 0xd0f523c9e73e6f3d68c16ae883a9febc616e484c4998a72d8899a1009e5a89d6 --amount 100000000
```

### Using the faucet in the TypeScript SDK

Here is an example funding the account `0xd0f523c9e73e6f3d68c16ae883a9febc616e484c4998a72d8899a1009e5a89d6` with 1 APT in Devnet. The amount used is in Octas (1 APT = 1,000,000,000 Octas).

```ts filename="index.ts"
import { Aptos, AptosConfig, Network } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";

const aptos = new Aptos(new AptosConfig({network: Network.Devnet}));
aptos.fundAccount({accountAddress: "0xd0f523c9e73e6f3d68c16ae883a9febc616e484c4998a72d8899a1009e5a89d6", amount: 100000000});
```

### Using the faucet in the Go SDK

Here is an example funding the account `0xd0f523c9e73e6f3d68c16ae883a9febc616e484c4998a72d8899a1009e5a89d6` with 1 APT in Devnet. The amount used is in Octas (1 APT = 1,000,000,000 Octas).

```go filename="index.go"
import "github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-go-sdk"

func main() {
	client, err := aptos.NewClient(aptos.LocalnetConfig)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

  client.Fund("0xd0f523c9e73e6f3d68c16ae883a9febc616e484c4998a72d8899a1009e5a89d6", 100000000)
}
```

### Calling the faucet: Other languages not supported by SDKs

If you are trying to call the faucet in other languages, you have two options:

1. Generate a client from
the [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/crates/aptos-faucet/doc/spec.yaml).
2. Call the faucet on your own.

For the latter, you will want to build a query similar to this:

```bash filename="Terminal"
curl -X POST
'https://faucet.devnet.aptoslabs.com/mint?amount=10000&address=0xd0f523c9e73e6f3d68c16ae883a9febc616e484c4998a72d8899a1009e5a89d6'
```

This means mint 10000 [octas](../../network/glossary.mdx#Octa) to
address `0xd0f523c9e73e6f3d68c16ae883a9febc616e484c4998a72d8899a1009e5a89d6`.
