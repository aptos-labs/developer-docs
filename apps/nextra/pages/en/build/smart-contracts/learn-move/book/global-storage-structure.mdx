# Global Storage - Structure

The purpose of Move programs is to [read from and write to](global-storage-operators.mdx) tree-shaped persistent global storage. Programs cannot access the filesystem, network, or any other data outside of this tree.

In pseudocode, the global storage looks something like:

```move
module 0x42::example {
  struct GlobalStorage {
    resources: Map<(address, ResourceType), ResourceValue>,
    modules: Map<(address, ModuleName), ModuleBytecode>
  }
}
```

Structurally, global storage is a [forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)) consisting of trees rooted at an account [`address`](address.mdx). Each address can store both [resource](structs-and-resources.mdx) data values and [module](modules-and-scripts.mdx) code values. As the pseudocode above indicates, each `address` can store at most one resource value of a given type and at most one module with a given name.
