# Move Objects
In Move, Objects group resources together so they can be treated as a single entity on chain.

Objects have their own address and can own resources similar to an account. They are useful for representing more complicated data types on-chain as Objects can be used in entry functions directly, and can be transferred as complete packages instead of one resource at a time.

Here's an example of creating an Object and transferring it:

```move filename="Example.move"
module my_addr::object_playground {
  use std::signer;
  use std::string::{Self, String};
  use aptos_framework::object::{Self, ObjectCore};
  
  struct MyStruct1 {
    message: String,
  }
  
  struct MyStruct2 {
    message: String,
  }
 
  entry fun create_and_transfer(caller: &signer, destination: address) {
    // Create object
    let caller_address = signer::address_of(caller);
    let constructor_ref = object::create_object(caller_address);
    let object_signer = object::generate_signer(constructor_ref);
    
    // Set up the object by creating 2 resources in it
    move_to(&object_signer, MyStruct1 {
      message: string::utf8(b"hello")
    });
    move_to(&object_signer, MyStruct2 {
      message: string::utf8(b"world")
    });
 
    // Transfer to destination
    let object = object::object_from_constructor_ref<ObjectCore>(
      &constructor_ref
    );
    object::transfer(caller, object, destination);
  }
}
```

During construction, Objects can be configured to be transferrable, burnable, and extensible.

For example, you could use an Object to represent a soulbound NFT by making it only transferrable once, and have it own resources for an image link and metadata. Objects can also own other Objects, so you could implement your own NFT collection Object by transferring several of the soulbound NFTs to it.
