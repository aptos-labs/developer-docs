# Move Prover

The Move Prover supports formal [specification](prover/spec-lang.mdx) and
[verification](prover/prover-guide.mdx) of Move code. The Move Prover can
automatically validate logical properties of Move smart contracts while offering
a user experience similar to a type checker or linter.

The Move Prover exists to make contracts more _trustworthy_; it:

- Protects massive assets managed by the Aptos blockchain from smart contract bugs
- Protects against well-resourced adversaries
- Anticipates justified regulator scrutiny and compliance requirements
- Allows domain experts with a mathematical background, but not necessarily a
software engineering background, to understand what smart contracts do

For more information, refer to the documentation:
