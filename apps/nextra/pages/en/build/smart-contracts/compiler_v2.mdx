# Move On Aptos Compiler

The Move on Aptos compiler (codename 'compiler v2') is a new tool which translates Move source code into Move bytecode. It unifies the architectures of the Move compiler and the Move Prover, enabling faster innovation in the Move language. It also offers new tools for defining code optimizations which can be leveraged to generate more gas efficient code for Move programs.

The new compiler supports Move 2, the latest revision of the Move language. Head over to the [release page in the book](book/move-2.mdx) to learn more about the new features in Move 2. Starting at Aptos CLI v6.0.0, this language version and the new compiler are the default.

## Compiler v2 Release State

Compiler v2 is now the default.

## Bug Bounty

We award a bounty for each unique semantic bug identified in the compiler. Bugs need to surface as a difference of execution outcome of the v1 and v2 compilers, as demonstrated by a Move unit test. Not all differences in the compiler behavior count for the program, [head over here](https://hackenproof.com/programs/move-on-aptos-compiler) for details of the bounty program. Even if a difference in behavior does not qualify for a bounty, we encourage you to open an issue using the link below.

## Reporting an Issue

If you run into issues, please use [this link to create a github issue][bug]. If you are able to provide a small piece of Move code which reproduces the issue, debugging and fixing it will be easier for us.

## Using Compiler v2

Ensure to have installed the latest version of the Aptos CLI:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos update aptos # on supported OS
brew upgrade aptos # on MacOS
```

Compiler v2 and Move 2 are now the default, requiring no changes to your usage. Examples:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos move compile
aptos move test
aptos move prove
```

## Using Compiler v1

Compiler v1 (i.e., the old compiler) is expected to be sunset soon, as it does not support any of the Move 2 features, and is thus not recommended for use. However, if you still want to use compiler v1 before it is sunset, on your project that does not use any Move 2 features, you can do so with the `--move-1` flag (eg., `aptos move compile --move-1` or `aptos move test --move-1`). You may need to specify the `aptos-release-v1.25` version of the Aptos framework in the dependencies (this is the last version of the Aptos framework that does not use any Move 2 features), as shown below.

```toml filename="Move.toml"
[dependencies.AptosFramework]
git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-framework.git"
rev = "aptos-release-v1.25"
subdir = "aptos-framework"
```
