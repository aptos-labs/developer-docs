# Move On Aptos Compiler

The Move on Aptos compiler (codename 'compiler v2') translates Move source code into Move bytecode. It unifies the architectures of the Move compiler and the Move Prover, enabling faster innovation in the Move language. It also offers new tools for defining code optimizations which can be leveraged to generate more gas efficient code for Move programs.

The Move on Aptos compiler supports Move 2, the latest revision of the Move language. Head over to the [release page in the book](book/move-2.mdx) to learn more about the new features in Move 2. Starting at Aptos CLI v6.0.0, this language version and the Move on Aptos compiler are the default. Note that Move 2 is generally backwards compatible with Move 1.

## Move on Aptos Release State

Move on Aptos is in production and is now the default compiler, with Move 2 being the default language version.

## Reporting an Issue

If you run into issues, please use [this link to create a github issue][bug]. If you are able to provide a small piece of Move code which reproduces the issue, debugging and fixing it will be easier for us.

## Using Move on Aptos Compiler

Ensure to have installed the latest version of the Aptos CLI:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos update aptos # on supported OS
brew upgrade aptos # on MacOS
```

Move on Aptos compiler and Move 2 are now the default, requiring no changes to your usage. Examples:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos move compile
aptos move test
aptos move prove
```
