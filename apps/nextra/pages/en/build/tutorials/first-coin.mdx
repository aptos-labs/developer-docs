# Your First Coin

This tutorial introduces how you can compile, deploy, and mint your own coin, named [MoonCoin](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/main/aptos-move/move-examples/moon_coin).

## Step 1: Pick an SDK

Install your preferred SDK from the below list:

- [TypeScript SDK](../sdks/ts-sdk.mdx)
- [Python SDK](../sdks/python-sdk.mdx)

---

## Step 2: Install the CLI

[Install the precompiled binary for the Aptos CLI](../cli.mdx).

---

## Step 3: Run the example

<Tabs items={["TypeScript", "Python"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

Clone the `aptos-ts-sdk` repo and build it:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-ts-sdk.git
cd aptos-ts-sdk
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Navigate to the TypeScript examples directory:

```bash filename="Terminal"
cd examples/typescript/
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm install
```

Run the TypeScript [`your_coin`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-ts-sdk/blob/main/examples/typescript/your_coin.ts) example:

```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm run your_coin
```

The application will complete, printing:

```bash filename="Terminal"
Bob's initial MoonCoin balance: 0.
Alice mints herself 100 MoonCoin.
Alice transfers 100 MoonCoin to Bob.
Bob's updated MoonCoin balance: 100.
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

Clone the `aptos-core` repo:

```bash filename="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core
```

Navigate to the Python SDK directory:

```bash filename="Terminal"
cd aptos-core/ecosystem/python/sdk
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash filename="Terminal"
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3
poetry install
```

Run the Python [`your_coin`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/ecosystem/python/sdk/examples/your_coin.py) example:

```bash filename="Terminal"
poetry run python -m examples.your_coin ~/aptos-core/aptos-move/move-examples/moon_coin
```

### Step 3.1: Build the package

The example run will pause with the following output:

```bash filename="Terminal"
=== Addresses ===
Alice: 0x5e603a89cf690d7134cf2f24fdb16ba90c4f5686333721c12e835fb6c76bc7ba
Bob: 0xc8421fa4a99153f955e50f1de2a6acff2f3fd0bb33aa17ba1f5b32b699f6c825

Update the package with Alice's address, compile, and press enter.
```

At this point, open another terminal and change directories to the MoonCoin package's directory:

```bash filename="Terminal"
cd ~/aptos-core/aptos-move/move-examples/moon_coin
```

Next, build the package using the CLI:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos move compile --named-addresses MoonCoin=0x5e603a89cf690d7134cf2f24fdb16ba90c4f5686333721c12e835fb6c76bc7ba --save-metadata
```

The `--named-addresses` is a list of address mappings that must be translated in order for the package to be compiled to be stored in Alice's account. Notice how `MoonCoin` is set to Alice's address printed above. Also `--save-metadata` is required to publish the package.

---

### Step 3.2: Completing the example

Returning to the previous prompt, press ENTER as the package is now ready to be published.

The application will complete, printing:

```bash filename="Terminal"

Publishing MoonCoin package.

Bob registers the newly created coin so he can receive it from Alice.
Bob's initial MoonCoin balance: 0.
Alice mints Bob some of the new coin.
Bob's updated MoonCoin balance: 100.
```

## Step 4: MoonCoin in depth

### Step 4.1: Building and publishing the MoonCoin package

Move contracts are effectively a set of Move modules known as a package. When deploying or upgrading a new package, the compiler must be invoked with `--save-metadata` to publish the package. In the case of MoonCoin, the following output files are critical:

- `build/Examples/package-metadata.bcs`: Contains the metadata associated with the package.
- `build/Examples/bytecode_modules/moon_coin.mv`: Contains the bytecode for the `moon_coin.move` module.

These are read by the example and published to the Aptos blockchain:

<Tabs items={["TypeScript", "Python"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

In the TypeScript example, we use `aptos move build-publish-payload` command to compile and build the module.
That command builds the `build` folder that contains the `package-metadata.bcs` and the bytecode for the `moon_coin.mv` module. The command also builds a publication transaction payload and stores it in a JSON output file that we can later read from to get the `metadataBytes` and `byteCode` to publish the contract to chain with.

Compile the package:

```ts filename="example.ts"
export function compilePackage(
  packageDir: string,
  outputFile: string,
  namedAddresses: Array<{ name: string; address: AccountAddress }>,
) {
  const addressArg = namedAddresses
    .map(({ name, address }) => `${name}=${address}`)
    .join(" ");
  // Assume-yes automatically overwrites the previous compiled version, only do this if you are sure you want to overwrite the previous version.
  const compileCommand = `aptos move build-publish-payload --json-output-file ${outputFile} --package-dir ${packageDir} --named-addresses ${addressArg} --assume-yes`;
  execSync(compileCommand);
}

compilePackage("move/moonCoin", "move/moonCoin/moonCoin.json", [
  { name: "MoonCoin", address: alice.accountAddress },
]);
```

Publish the package to chain:

```ts filename="example.ts"
export function getPackageBytesToPublish(filePath: string) {
  // current working directory - the root folder of this repo
  const cwd = process.cwd();
  // target directory - current working directory + filePath (filePath JSON file is generated with the previous, compilePackage, CLI command)
  const modulePath = path.join(cwd, filePath);

  const jsonData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(modulePath, "utf8"));

  const metadataBytes = jsonData.args[0].value;
  const byteCode = jsonData.args[1].value;

  return { metadataBytes, byteCode };
}

const { metadataBytes, byteCode } = getPackageBytesToPublish(
  "move/moonCoin/moonCoin.json",
);

// Publish MoonCoin package to chain
const transaction = await aptos.publishPackageTransaction({
  account: alice.accountAddress,
  metadataBytes,
  moduleBytecode: byteCode,
});

const pendingTransaction = await aptos.signAndSubmitTransaction({
  signer: alice,
  transaction,
});

await aptos.waitForTransaction({ transactionHash: pendingTransaction.hash });
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

```python filename="example.py"
module_path = os.path.join(
    moon_coin_path, "build", "Examples", "bytecode_modules", "moon_coin.mv"
)
with open(module_path, "rb") as f:
    module = f.read()

metadata_path = os.path.join(
    moon_coin_path, "build", "Examples", "package-metadata.bcs"
)
with open(metadata_path, "rb") as f:
    metadata = f.read()

print("\nPublishing MoonCoin package.")
package_publisher = PackagePublisher(rest_client)
txn_hash = await package_publisher.publish_package(alice, metadata, [module])
await rest_client.wait_for_transaction(txn_hash)
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 4.2: Understanding the MoonCoin module

The MoonCoin module defines the `MoonCoin` struct, or the distinct type of coin type. In addition, it contains a function called `init_module`. The `init_module` function is called when the module is published. In this case, MoonCoin initializes the `MoonCoin` coin type as a `ManagedCoin`, which is maintained by the owner of the account.

<Callout type="info">
ManagedCoin framework
[`ManagedCoin`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/f81ccb01f00227f9c0f36856fead4879f185a9f6/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/managed_coin.move#L1) is a simple coin management framework for coins directly managed by users. It provides convenience wrappers around `mint` and `burn`.
</Callout>

```move filename="moon_coin.mv"
module MoonCoin::moon_coin {
    struct MoonCoin {}

    fun init_module(sender: &signer) {
        aptos_framework::managed_coin::initialize<MoonCoin>(
            sender,
            b"Moon Coin",
            b"MOON",
            6,
            false,
        );
    }
}
```

### Step 4.3: Understanding coins

Coins have several primitives:

- **Minting**: Creating new coins.
- **Burning**: Deleting coins.
- **Freezing**: Preventing an account from storing coins in `CoinStore`.
- **Registering**: Creating a `CoinStore` resource on an account for storing coins.
- **Transferring**: Withdrawing and depositing coins into `CoinStore`.

<Callout type="info">

The entity that creates a new coin gains the capabilities for minting, burning, and freezing.
</Callout>

---

#### Step 4.3.1: Initializing a coin

Once a coin type has been published to the Aptos blockchain, the entity that published that coin type can initialize it:

```move
module 0x1::coin {
    public fun initialize<CoinType>(
        account: &signer,
        name: string::String,
        symbol: string::String,
        decimals: u8,
        monitor_supply: bool,
    ): (BurnCapability<CoinType>, FreezeCapability<CoinType>, MintCapability<CoinType>) {
        let account_addr = signer::address_of(account);

        assert!(
            coin_address<CoinType>() == account_addr,
            error::invalid_argument(ECOIN_INFO_ADDRESS_MISMATCH),
        );

        assert!(
            !exists<CoinInfo<CoinType>>(account_addr),
            error::already_exists(ECOIN_INFO_ALREADY_PUBLISHED),
        );

        let coin_info = CoinInfo<CoinType> {
            name,
            symbol,
            decimals,
            supply: if (monitor_supply) { option::some(optional_aggregator::new(MAX_U128, false)) } else { option::none() },
        };
        move_to(account, coin_info);

        (BurnCapability<CoinType>{ }, FreezeCapability<CoinType>{ }, MintCapability<CoinType>{ })
  }
}
```

This ensures that this coin type has never been initialized before. Notice the check on lines 10 and 15 to ensure that the caller to `initialize` is the same one that actually published this module, and that there is no `CoinInfo` stored on their account. If both those conditions check, then a `CoinInfo` is stored and the caller obtains capabilities for burning, freezing, and minting.

<Callout type="info">
MoonCoin calls this `initialize` function automatically upon package publishing.
</Callout>

---

#### Step 4.3.2: Registering a coin

To use a coin, an entity must register a `CoinStore` for it on their account:

```move"
public entry fun registerCoinType(account: &signer) {
```

MoonCoin uses `ManagedCoin` that provides an entry function wrapper: `managed_coin::register`. Here is an example script for registration:

```move
script {
    fun register(account: &signer) {
        aptos_framework::managed_coin::register<MoonCoin::moon_coin::MoonCoin>(account)
    }
}
```

---

#### Step 4.3.3: Minting a coin

Minting coins requires the mint capability that was produced during initialization. the function `mint` (see below) takes in that capability and an amount, and returns back a `Coin<T>` struct containing that amount of coins. If the coin tracks supply, it will be updated.

```move
module 0x1::coin {
    public fun mint<CoinType>(
        amount: u64,
        _cap: &MintCapability<CoinType>,
    ): Coin<CoinType> acquires CoinInfo {
        if (amount == 0) {
            return zero<CoinType>()
        };

        let maybe_supply = &mut borrow_global_mut<CoinInfo<CoinType>>(coin_address<CoinType>()).supply;
        if (option::is_some(maybe_supply)) {
            let supply = option::borrow_mut(maybe_supply);
            optional_aggregator::add(supply, (amount as u128));
        };

        Coin<CoinType> { value: amount }
    }
}
```

`ManagedCoin` makes this easier by providing an entry function `managed_coin::mint`.

---

#### Step 4.3.4: Transferring a coin

Aptos provides several building blocks to support coin transfers:

- `coin::deposit<CoinType>`: Allows any entity to deposit a coin into an account that has already called `coin::register<CoinType>`.
- `coin::withdraw<CoinType>`: Allows any entity to extract a coin amount from their account.
- `aptos_account::transfer_coins<CoinType>`: Transfer coins of specific CoinType to a receiver.

<Callout type="info">
There are two separate withdraw and deposit events instead of a single transfer event.
</Callout>
