### Comparing Token Standards in Detail

|                        | Solidity                                                          | Move (Aptos)                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Token Structure**    | Each token is its own contract.                                   | Every token is a typed `Coin` or `FungibleAsset` using a single, reusable contract.                                                                             |
| **Token Standard**     | Must conform to standards like ERC20; implementations can vary.   | Uniform interface and implementation for all tokens.                                                                                                            |
| **Balance Storage**    | Balances stored in contract using a mapping structure.            | **Resource-Oriented Balance**: Balances stored as a resource in the user's account. Resources cannot be arbitrarily created, ensuring integrity of token value. |
| **Transfer Mechanism** | Tokens can be transferred without receiver's explicit permission. | Except for specific cases (like AptosCoin), Tokens generally require receiver's `signer` authority for transfer.                                                |

### Comparing EVM and Move VM in Detail

- **EVM**: Known for its flexibility and dynamic dispatch, which allows a wide range of smart contract behaviors. This flexibility, however, can lead to complexities in parallel execution and network operations.
- **Move VM**: Focuses on safety and efficiency with a more integrated approach between the VM and the programming language. Its data storage model allows for better parallelization, and its static dispatch method enhances security and predictability.

|                                 | EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)                                         | Move VM (Move Virtual Machine)                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Storage**                | Data is stored in the smart contract's storage space.                  | Data is stored across smart contracts, user accounts, and objects.                                                 |
| **Parallelization**             | Parallel execution is limited due to shared storage space.             | More parallel execution enabled due to flexible split storage design.                                              |
| **VM and Language Integration** | Separate layers for EVM and smart contract languages (e.g., Solidity). | Seamless integration between VM layer and Move language, with native functions written in Rust executable in Move. |
| **Critical Network Operations** | Implementation of network operations can be complex and less direct.   | Critical operations like validator set management natively implemented in Move, allowing for direct execution.     |
| **Function Calling**            | Dynamic dispatch allows for arbitrary smart contract calls.            | Static dispatch aligns with a focus on security and predictable behavior.                                          |
| **Type Safety**                 | Contract types provide a level of type safety.                         | Module structs and generics in Move offer robust type safety.                                                      |
| **Transaction Safety**          | Uses nonces for transaction ordering and safety.                       | Uses sequence numbers for transaction ordering and safety.                                                         |
| **Authenticated Storage**       | Yes, with smart contract storage.                                      | Yes, leveraging Move’s resource model.                                                                             |
| **Object Accessibility**        | Objects are not globally accessible; bound to smart contract scope.    | Guaranteed global accessibility of objects.                                                                        |
