# Card

`<Card />` components are typically structured with a title, description, and a link
that references another part of the docs. They enable you to highlight areas where readers may want to
learn more and are often used for things like links for quickstart / summary pages. 

## Usage

Suppose you want to mimic the following `<Card />` layout. 

<Cards>
  <Card href="./docs/setup/organize-files">
    <Card.Title>Organize Files</Card.Title>
    <Card.Description>How file-based routing works with Nextra.</Card.Description>
  </Card>
  <Card href="./docs/setup/organize-files-advanced">
    <Card.Title>Organize Files (Advanced)</Card.Title>
    <Card.Description>How to customize file routing, use `_meta.tsx` files, hide routes, and more</Card.Description>
  </Card>
</Cards>

To do so you can do the following:


```mdx filename="index.mdx"
import { Card, Cards } from '@components/index'

...

<Cards>
  <Card href="./docs/setup/organize-files">
    <Card.Title>Organize Files</Card.Title>
    <Card.Description>How file-based routing works with Nextra.</Card.Description>
  </Card>
  <Card href="./docs/setup/organize-files-advanced">
    <Card.Title>Organize Files (Advanced)</Card.Title>
    <Card.Description>How to customize file routing, use `_meta.tsx` files, hide routes, and more</Card.Description>
  </Card>
</Cards>
```
