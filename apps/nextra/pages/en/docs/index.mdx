### Installation

> Note: Make sure you have installed `node >= 20`, and `pnpm` before beginning

To create a new docs site from scratch, navigate to your repo or the shared docs repository and do:

```sh filename="Terminal"
pnpx @aptos-labs/create-docs
```

This should prompt you to enter the name of the docs site and will configure a brand new Aptos Docs site with Nextra.

```sh filename="Terminal"
pnpm install
```

### Develop

Navigate to the root of the project and run

```sh filename="Terminal"
pnpm dev
```

### Publish

Publishing is easiest done via Vercel. See the [deployment guide](/en/docs/setup/deployment) for more information.
