# Computing Transaction Gas

Aptos transactions by default charge a base gas fee, regardless of market conditions.
For each transaction, this "base gas" amount is based on three conditions:

1. Instructions.
2. Storage.
3. Payload.

The more function calls, branching conditional statements, etc. that a transaction requires, the more instruction gas it will cost.
Likewise, the more reads from and writes into global storage that a transaction requires, the more storage gas it will cost.
Finally, the more bytes in a transaction payload, the more it will cost.

As explained in the [optimization principles](#optimization-principles) section, storage gas has by far the largest effect on base gas. For background on the Aptos gas model, see [The Making of the Aptos Gas Schedule](https://aptoslabs.medium.com/the-making-of-the-aptos-gas-schedule-508d5686a350).

Additional storage gas parameters are defined in [`table.rs`], [`move_stdlib.rs`], and other assorted source files in [`aptos-gas-schedule/src/`].

## IO and Storage charges

The following gas parameters are applied (i.e., charged) to represent the costs associated with transient storage device resources, including disk IOPS and bandwidth:

| Parameter                       | Meaning                                                           |

| storage_io_per_state_byte_write | charged per byte in all state write ops in the transaction output |
| storage_io_per_state_slot_read  | charged per item loaded from global state                         |
| storage_io_per_state_byte_read  | charged per byte loaded from global state                         |

The following storage fee parameters are applied (i.e., charged in absolute APT values) to represent the disk space and structural costs associated with using the [Aptos authenticated data structure](../reference/glossary.md#merkle-trees) for storing items on the blockchain. This encompasses actions such as creating things in the global state, emitting events, and similar operations:

| Parameter                         | Meaning                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| free_write_bytes_quota            | 1KB (configurable) free bytes per state slot. (_Subject to short-term change._)                                                                 |
| free_event_bytes_quota            | 1KB (configurable) free event bytes per transaction. (_Subject to short-term change._)                                                          |
| storage_fee_per_state_slot_create | allocating a state slot, by `move_to()`, `table::add()`, etc                                                                                    |
| storage_fee_per_excess_state_byte | per byte beyond `free_write_bytes_quota` per state slot. Notice this is charged every time the slot is written to, not only at allocation time. |
| storage_fee_per_event_byte        | per byte beyond `free_event_bytes_quota` per transaction.                                                                                       |
| storage_fee_per_transaction_byte  | each transaction byte beyond `large_transaction_cutoff`. (search in the page)                                                                   |

### Vectors

Byte-wise fees are similarly assessed on vectors, which consume $\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} e_i + b(n)$ bytes, where:

- $n$ is the number of elements in the vector
- $e_i$ is the size of element $i$
- $b(n)$ is a "base size" which is a function of $n$

See the [BCS sequence specification] for more information on vector base size (technically a `ULEB128`), which typically occupies just one byte in practice, such that a vector of 100 `u8` elements accounts for $100 + 1 = 101$ bytes.
Hence, per the item-wise read methodology described above, reading the last element of such a vector is treated as a 101-byte read.

## Payload gas

Payload gas is defined in [`transaction.rs`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs), which incorporates storage gas with several payload- and pricing-associated parameters:

| Parameter                       | Meaning                                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `min_transaction_gas_units`     | Minimum internal gas units for a transaction, charged at the start of execution        |
| `large_transaction_cutoff`      | Size, in bytes, above which transactions will be charged an additional amount per byte |
| `intrinsic_gas_per_byte`        | Internal gas units charged per byte for payloads above `large_transaction_cutoff`      |
| `maximum_number_of_gas_units`   | Upper limit on external gas units for a transaction                                    |
| `min_price_per_gas_unit`        | Minimum gas price allowed for a transaction                                            |
| `max_price_per_gas_unit`        | Maximum gas price allowed for a transaction                                            |
| `max_transaction_size_in_bytes` | Maximum transaction payload size in bytes                                              |
| `gas_unit_scaling_factor`       | Conversion factor between internal gas units and external gas units                    |

Here, "internal gas units" are defined as constants in source files like [`instr.rs`] and [`storage_gas.move`], which are more granular than "external gas units" by a factor of `gas_unit_scaling_factor`:
to convert from internal gas units to external gas units, divide by `gas_unit_scaling_factor`.
Then, to convert from external gas units to octas, multiply by the "gas price", which denotes the number of octas per unit of external gas.

## Optimization principles

### Unit and pricing constants

As of the time of this writing, `min_price_per_gas_unit` in [`transaction.rs`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs) is defined as [`aptos_global_constants`]`::GAS_UNIT_PRICE` (which is itself defined as 100), with other noteworthy [`transaction.rs`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs) constants as follows:

| Constant                  | Value          |
| ------------------------- | -------------- |
| `min_price_per_gas_unit`  | 100            |
| `max_price_per_gas_unit`  | 10,000,000,000 |
| `gas_unit_scaling_factor` | 1,000,000      |

See [Payload gas](#payload-gas) for the meaning of these constants.

### Storage Fee

When the network load is low, the gas unit price is expected to be low, making most aspects of the transaction cost more affordable. However, the storage fee is an exception, as it's priced in terms of absolute APT value. In most instances, the transaction fee is the predominant component of the overall transaction cost. This is especially true when a transaction allocates state slots, writes to sizable state items, emits numerous or large events, or when the transaction itself is a large one. All of these factors consume disk space on Aptos nodes and are charged accordingly.

On the other hand, the storage refund incentivizes releasing state slots by deleting state items. The state slot fee is fully refunded upon slot deallocation, while the excess state byte fee is non-refundable. This will soon change by differentiating between permanent bytes (those in the global state) and relative ephemeral bytes (those that traverse the ledger history).

Some cost optimization strategies concerning the storage fee:

1. Minimize state item creation.
2. Minimize event emissions.
3. Avoid large state items, events, and transactions.
4. Clean up state items that are no longer in use.
5. If two fields are consistently updated together, group them into the same resource or resource group.
6. If a struct is large and only a few fields are updated frequently, move those fields to a separate resource or resource group.

### Instruction gas

As of the time of this writing, all instruction gas operations are multiplied by the `EXECUTION_GAS_MULTIPLIER` defined in [`meter.rs`], which is set to 20.
Hence, the following representative operations assume gas costs as follows (divide internal gas by scaling factor, then multiply by minimum gas price):

| Operation                    | Minimum Octas |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| Table add/borrow/remove box  | 240           |
| Function call                | 200           |
| Load constant                | 130           |
| Globally borrow              | 100           |
| Read/write reference         | 40            |
| Load `u128` on stack         | 16            |
| Table box operation per byte | 2             |

(Note that per-byte table box operation instruction gas does not account for storage gas, which is assessed separately).

For comparison, reading a 100-byte item costs $r_i + 100 * r_b = 3000 + 100 * 3 = 3300$ octas at minimum, some 16.5 times as much as a function call, and in general, instruction gas costs are largely dominated by storage gas costs.

Notably, however, there is still technically an incentive to reduce the number of function calls in a program, but engineering efforts are more effectively dedicated to writing modular, decomposed code that is geared toward reducing storage gas costs, rather than attempting to write repetitive code blocks with fewer nested functions (in nearly all cases).

In extreme cases it is possible for instruction gas to far outweigh storage gas, for example if a looping mathematical function takes 10,000 iterations to converge; but again this is an extreme case and for most applications storage gas has a larger impact on base gas than does instruction gas.

### Payload gas

As of the time of this writing, [`transaction/mod.rs`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/aptos-gas-schedule/src/gas_schedule/transaction.rs) defines the minimum amount of internal gas per transaction as 1,500,000 internal units (15,000 octas at minimum), an amount that increases by 2,000 internal gas units (20 octas minimum) per byte for payloads larger than 600 bytes, with the maximum number of bytes permitted in a transaction set at 65536.
Hence, in practice, payload gas is unlikely to be a concern.
