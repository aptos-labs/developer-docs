# Execution

In Aptos, execution refers to the process by which validators 
run and apply smart contract transactions from ordered blocks to update the blockchainâ€™s state.

It is crucial because validators must agree on the same final state, post-execution,
ensuring consistency and security across the network.

Efficient execution, particularly parallel execution, is key to scaling blockchain performance and throughput.

## Why Parallel Execution?

Smart contract execution is a major throughput bottleneck for blockchains. 
After proposing blocks and agreeing on their order, validators have to execute the 
transactions in the ordered blocks. Crucially, validators must arrive at the same final state, 
which must correspond to some sequential execution of the transactions. 
Due to the lack of a foundational solution, current blockchains either execute 
sequentially or require an embarrassingly parallel workload (i.e. no inner conflicts) 
for improved performance. Sequential execution does not scale well, and assuming that 
all transactions are commutative is unrealistic when considering a broad range of smart contracts. 

In fact, transactions in a blockchain can have a significant number of access conflicts due to 
potential performance attacks, accessing popular contracts 
(e.g. due to economic opportunities such as auctions and arbitrage).

## Block-STM

We designed and implemented a highly efficient, multi-threaded, in-memory parallel 
execution engine. It leverages the preset order of transactions and combines 
Software Transactional Memory techniques with a novel collaborative schedule.

Block-STM is the state-of-the-art dynamic parallelism execution engine developed by the Aptos Labs team.

Dynamic parallelism allows developers to flexibly write applications without 
facing design constraints of statically declaring write sets of transactions.
