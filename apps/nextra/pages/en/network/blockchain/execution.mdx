# Execution

On Aptos, execution refers to the process where validators run and apply smart contract transactions
from an ordered block. The execution output is then applied to the blockchain state.

It is crucial for execution to be
[deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm), and all validators should
ideally agree on the same final state of the ledger. A majority of validators (more than 2/3 of the
validators) must agree on the final state of the ledger in order to come to a consensus. For more
detailed information on consensus properties, see the section on
[BFT](../glossary#byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft) and [consensus](../glossary#consensus).

Efficient execution, particularly parallel execution, is key to scaling blockchain performance and
throughput. The impact of this can be felt in the block time. As of December 2024, Aptos blocks close within 250ms.

## Why Parallel Execution?

The simplest approach for smart contract execution is to execute the transactions in a block
sequentially, one at a time. However, this does not scale well. Having a large number of sequential
transactions, especially with varying execution times, can cause the latency and throughput of the
blockchain to drop drastically.

To solve this problem, blockchains began to adopt parallel execution, or the ability to process
multiple transactions in parallel. The challenge with parallel execution, however, is that certain
transactions may read or write the same resource, causing conflicts.

### Static Parallelism

One approach to address the conflict issue in parallel execution is **static parallelism**, which
requires developers to specify the conflicts between transactions ahead of time. This, however,
brings a higher burden on the developer, and in many cases forces transactions that don't actually
conflict to be sequential.

### Dynamic Parallelism

**Dynamic parallelism** computes the execution ordering of transactions on-the-fly, dynamically
detecting dependencies and avoiding conflicts during execution. An additional property that is
important for dynamic parallelism on a blockchain is that the execution output is consistent with
executing transactions according to a preset order.

By not requiring developers to specify the conflicts ahead of time, dynamic parallelism allows
developers to flexibly write applications without facing the design constraints of statically
declaring transaction dependencies.

## Block-STM

Aptos uses a highly efficient, multi-threaded, in-memory parallel execution engine called Block-STM.
Block-STM leverages the preset order of transactions and combines Software Transactional Memory
techniques with a novel collaborative schedule.

Block-STM is the state-of-the-art dynamic parallelism execution engine developed by the Aptos Labs
team.

Since its release, [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/blog/innovating-the-main-chain-a-polygon-pos-study-in-parallelization), Sei,
[Starknet](https://www.starknet.io/blog/parallel-execution-and-v0-13-2/), and other blockchains have
adopted it to achieve parallel execution on their respective chains.
