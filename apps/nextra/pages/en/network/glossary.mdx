# Aptos Glossary

## A

### Accumulator Root Hash

- An **accumulator root hash** is the root hash of
  a [Merkle accumulator](https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/625.pdf).

### Account

- An **account** in the Aptos blockchain is a container for an arbitrary number
  of [Move modules](#move-module) and [Move resources](#move-resources).
- The state of each account is composed of both code and data.
- The account is identified by [account address](#account-address).

See [Accounts](blockchain/accounts.mdx) for more information.

### Account Address

- An **account address** is the address of an Aptos account.
- Account address refers to a specific destination on the Aptos network. The
  address dictates the destination and source of a specific amount of assets
  exchanged by two parties on the blockchain.
- Aptos addresses are 64-character hex string (32 bytes). Often times these
  strings are prefixed with `0x` and for first 16 addresses, the leading 0s are
  excluded (ex. `0x1`)

See [Accounts](blockchain/accounts.mdx) for more information.

### API

- An **Application Programming Interface (API)** is a set of protocols and tools
  that allow users to interact with Aptos blockchain nodes and client networks
  via external applications. Aptos offers a REST API to communicate with our
  nodes.
- See [documentation](../build/apis.mdx) for more details.

### APT

**Aptos token (APT)** is the Aptos blockchain native token used for paying
network and transaction fees.

### Aptos

**Aptos** is a Layer 1 blockchain for everyone. It uses the Move programming
language and launched its mainnet on 2022-10-17 to redefine the web3 user
experience. The Aptos blockchain is dedicated to creating better user
experiences through increased speed, security, scalability, reliability and
usability with low transaction costs. The word "Aptos" means "The People" in the
Ohlone language. Learn more about the Aptos blockchain on
the [official Aptos website](https://aptosfoundation.org).

### AptosBFT

- **AptosBFT** is the Aptos protocol's BFT consensus algorithm.
- AptosBFT is based on Jolteon.

### Aptos Blockchain

- The **Aptos blockchain** is a ledger of immutable transactions agreed upon by
  the validators on the Aptos network (the network of validators).

### Aptos Name Service (ANS)

- The **Aptos Name Service (ANS)** is a decentralized naming address service for
  the Aptos blockchain. An Aptos name is a human-readable _.apt_ domain name
  that is used in place of a public key, for example _love.apt_.
- This service also allows users to register subdomain names in addition to the
  registered domain. Find out more
  at: [Aptosnames.com](https://www.aptosnames.com/)

### Aptos Core

**Aptos-core** is
the [open-source repository](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/)
containing the code for Aptos Network software. Aptos-core contains software for

- the Aptos blockchain itself, which generates and stores the immutable ledger
  of confirmed transactions and
- the validation process, which implements the consensus algorithm to validate
  transactions and add them to the Aptos blockchain immutable ledger.

### Aptos Ecosystem

- **Aptos ecosystem** refers to various components of the Aptos blockchain
  network and their interactions. The Aptos ecosystem includes the
  community, [community-driven projects](https://aptosfoundation.org/ecosystem/projects/all),
  and [events](https://aptosfoundation.org/events).

### Aptos Explorer

- The **[Aptos Explorer](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/)** is an interface that
  helps users examine details of the Aptos blockchain, including account
  information, validators, and transactions.
- The Aptos Explorer help users validate their work in Aptos wallets and other
  tools in the blockchain.

### Aptos Framework

The **Aptos Framework** defines the public API for blockchain updates and the
structure of on-chain data. It defines the business logic and access control for
the three key pillars of Aptos functionality: payments, treasury, and on-chain
governance. It is implemented as a set of modules written in the Move
programming language and stored on-chain as Move bytecode.

### Aptos Node

An **Aptos node** is a peer entity of the Aptos network that tracks the state of
the Aptos blockchain. There are two types of Aptos
nodes, [validators](#validator) and [fullnodes](#fullnodes).

### Aptos Protocol

- **Aptos protocol** is the specification of how transactions are submitted,
  ordered, executed, and recorded within the Aptos network.

### AptosAccount

- A **`AptosAccount`** is a Move resource that holds all the administrative data
  associated with an account, such as sequence number, balance, and
  authentication key.
- A **`AptosAccount`** is the only resource that every account is guaranteed to
  contain.

### AptosAccount module

- **The AptosAccount module** is a Move module that contains the code for
  manipulating the administrative data held in a particular `AptosAccount.T`
  resource.
- Code for checking or incrementing sequence numbers, withdrawing or depositing
  currency, and extracting gas deposits is included in the AptosAccount module.

### Aptos Devnet

- See [devnet](#devnet).

## B

### Blocks

- On Aptos, blocks are a batch of [transactions](#transaction) committed at the
  same time.
- Block number is analogous to "block height" in blockchain literature.
- Transactions are referenced by ledger version rather than by block.

### BlockSTM

- **BlockSTM** is the state-of-the-art dynamic parallelism execution engine developed by the Aptos Labs team.
- Dynamic parallelism allows developers to flexibly write applications without facing design constraints of statically declaring write sets of transactions.
- It has been adopted across the industry by multiple blockchains.
- More details can be found in [the blog post](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/block-stm-how-we-execute-over-160k-transactions-per-second-on-the-aptos-blockchain-3b003657e4ba) and [presentation at a16z crypto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5tqPzhyw)

### Byzantine (Validator)

- A **validator** that does not follow the specification of the consensus
  protocol, and wishes to compromise the correct execution of the protocol.
- BFT algorithms traditionally support up to one-third of the algorithm's voting
  power being held by Byzantine validators.

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance** (BFT) is the ability of a distributed system to
  provide safety and liveness guarantees in the presence of faulty,
  or "[Byzantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault)," validators below a certain threshold.
- The Aptos blockchain uses AptosBFT, a consensus protocol based
  on [Jolteon](#jolteon).
- BFT algorithms typically operate with a number of entities, collectively
  holding $N$ votes (which are called "validators" in the Aptos network’s
  application of the system).
- $N$ is chosen to withstand some number of validators holding $f$ votes, which
  might be malicious.
- In this configuration, $N$ is typically set to $3f + 1$. Validators holding up to $f$
  votes will be allowed to be faulty &mdash; offline, malicious, slow, etc. As
  long as $2f + 1$ votes are held by [honest](#honest-validator) validators, they
  will be able to reach consensus on consistent decisions.
- This implies that BFT consensus protocols can function correctly, even if up
  to one-third of the voting power is held by validators that are compromised or
  fail.

## C

### CLI

- **Command line interface** refers to the Aptos CLI used for developing on the
  Aptos blockchain, operating nodes, and debugging issues. Find out more
  at [the Aptos CLI page](../build/cli.mdx).

### Client

- **Client** is software that receives information from the blockchain and
  manages transactions. Clients interact with the blockchain through the Aptos
  nodes.

### Code Labs

- **Code labs and tutorials** depict various workflows - such as the use of the
  Aptos CLI in minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) - in order for users to
  understand how the process works and employ related functions in their code.
  If users have the necessary funds in their accounts, they can follow the same
  code lab and tutorial steps used in devnet, testnet and mainnet networks.

### Consensus

- **Consensus** is a component of a validator.
- The consensus component is responsible for coordination and agreement amongst
  all validators on the block of transactions to be executed, their order, and
  the execution results.
- The Aptos blockchain is formed with these agreed-upon transactions and their
  corresponding execution results.
- The consensus component is accountable for achieving security, trust, and
  agreement among all validators on the Aptos blockchain.

### Consensus Protocol

- A **consensus protocol** is collectively executed by n validators to accept or
  reject a transaction and to agree on the ordering of transactions and
  execution results.
- See [BFT](#byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft).

## D

### Dapps

- **Decentralized applications (dapps)** are programs or digital applications
  that run on the Aptos blockchain autonomously. Smart contracts are commonly
  used to achieve this function.

### Devnet

- The **Aptos devnet** is a publicly deployed instance of the Aptos network that
  runs using a set of validator test nodes.
- The devnet is a demonstration of the Aptos network that is built for
  experimenting with new ideas
- The devnet simulates a digital payment system and the coins on the devnet have
  _no real world value_.
- The devnet is the network by which developers are given the opportunity to
  test given protocols. It is similar to testnet as it operates independently of
  the mainnet yet is reset weekly.

## E

### Ed25519

- **Ed25519** is our supported digital signature scheme.
- More specifically, the Aptos network uses the PureEdDSA scheme over the
  Ed25519 curve, as defined in RFC 8032.

### Epoch

- An **epoch** is the period of time between reconfigurations of the validator
  set and other administrative actions by the blockchain. On Aptos mainnet
  currently, it is every 2 hours.

### Event

- An **event** is the user-facing representation of the effects of executing a
  transaction.
- A transaction may be designed to emit any number of events as a list. For
  example, a `Coin<AptosCoin>` transfer emits a `WithdrawEvent` for the sender
  account and a `DepositEvent` for the recipient account.
- In the Aptos protocol, events provide evidence that the successful execution
  of a transaction resulted in a specific effect. The `DepositEvent` (in the
  above example) allows the recipient to confirm that a payment was received
  into their account.
- Events are persisted on the blockchain and are used to answer queries
  by [clients](#client).

### Execution

- **Execution** in the Aptos blockchain is an Aptos node component that manages
  the block of transactions. The execution component stores successful
  transactions.

### Expiration Time

A transaction ceases to be valid after its **expiration time**. If it is assumed
that:

- $Time_C$ is the current time that is agreed upon between validators ($Time_C$ is
  not the local time of the client);
- $Time_E$ is the expiration time of a transaction $T_N$; and
- $Time_C > Time_E$ and transaction $T_N$ has not been included in the blockchain,
then there is a guarantee that $T_N$ will never be included in the blockchain.

## F

### Faucet

- The **faucet** is a service that mints APT on devnet. For testnet see the [mint page](/network/faucet).
- APT on devnet and testnet has no real world value, it is only for development purposes.
- To use a faucet, see [Faucet API](../build/apis/faucet-api.mdx).

### Fullnodes

- **Fullnodes** are clients that ensure data are stored up-to-date on the
  network. They replicate blockchain state and transactions from other fullnodes
  and validator nodes.

### Fungible Asset

- A **fungible asset** is an asset, such as a currency, share, in-game resource,
  etc., that is interchangeable with another identical asset without any loss in
  its value. For example, APT is a fungible asset because you can exchange one
  APT for another.
- Follow the [Asset Standards](../build/smart-contracts/aptos-standards.mdx#asset-standards) to create
  fungible assets on the Aptos blockchain.
- Next generation of the Coin standard that addresses shortcomings
  of `aptos_framework::coin` such as lack of guaranteed enforcement of freeze
  and burn and advanced functionalities such as programmable transfers, e.g.,
  approve in ERC-20.

### Fungible Token

- For the legacy Aptos Token Standard (aptos_token::token), a **fungible token**
  is a token that is interchangeable with other identical tokens (i.e., tokens
  that share the same `TokenId`). This means the tokens have the
  same `creator address`, `collection name`, `token name`,
  and `property version`.
- For the Aptos Digital Asset Standard (aptos_token_objects::token), a *
  *fungible token** is a fungible asset with metadata object that includes a
  Digital Asset resource.

### Fungible Unit

- A **fungible unit** is an individual unit of a fungible asset. These units are
  identical and interchangeable without any loss in value. For example, each
  [Octa](#octa) (the smallest unit of APT) is a fungible unit.

## G

### Gas

- **Gas** is a way to pay for computation and storage on a blockchain network.
  All transactions on the Aptos network cost a certain amount of gas.
- The gas required for a transaction depends on the size of the transaction, the
  computational cost of executing the transaction, and the amount of additional
  global state created by the transaction (e.g., if new accounts are created).
- The purpose of gas is regulating demand for the limited computational and
  storage resources of the validators, including preventing denial of service (
  DoS) attacks.

See [Gas and Storage Fees](blockchain/gas-txn-fee.mdx) for more information.

### Gas Unit Price

- Each transaction specifies the **gas unit price** the sender is willing to pay
  per unit of gas.
- The price of gas required for a transaction depends on the current demand for
  usage of the network.
- Gas price is expressed in [Octas](#octa).

See [Gas and Storage Fees](blockchain/gas-txn-fee.mdx) for more information.

## H

### Honest (Validator)

- **Honesty** means a validator that faithfully executes the consensus protocol
  and is not Byzantine.

## I

### Indexer

- **[Indexer](../build/indexer.mdx)** is the component of Aptos that
  retrieves, processes, and efficiently stores raw data in the database to
  provide speedy access to the Aptos blockchain state.
- At a high level, indexer gets data from a gRPC stream and runs processors to
  transform raw blockchain data and serve transformed data via GraphQL endpoint.

## J

### Jolteon

- **Jolteon** is a recent proposal for a [BFT](#byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft)
  consensus protocol.
- AptosBFT, the Aptos network's consensus algorithm, is based on Jolteon.
- It simplifies the reasoning about safety, and it addresses some performance
  limitations of previous consensus protocols. In particular, it reduces latency
  by 33% compared to HotStuff.

## L

### Leader

- A **leader** is a validator that proposes a block of transactions for the
  consensus protocol.
- In leader-based protocols, nodes must agree on a leader to make progress.
- Leaders are selected by a function that takes the
  current [round number](#round-number) as input.

## M

### Mainnet

- **Mainnet** refers to a working, fully-operational blockchain. A mainnet
  network has been fully deployed and performs the functionality of transferring
  digital currency from a sender to a recipient.

### Maximum Gas Amount

- The **Maximum Gas Amount** of a transaction is the maximum gas amount in gas
  units that the sender is ready to pay for the transaction.
- The transaction can be successfully executed only if the gas used does not
  exceed the maximum gas amount.
- The gas charged is equal to the gas price multiplied by units of gas required
  to process this transaction.
- If the transaction runs out of gas while it is being executed or the account
  runs out of balance during execution, then the sender will be charged for gas
  used and the transaction will fail.

See [Gas and Storage Fees](blockchain/gas-txn-fee.mdx) for
more information.

### Mempool

- **Mempool** is one of the components of the validator. It holds an in-memory
  buffer of transactions that have been submitted but not yet agreed upon and
  executed. Mempool receives transactions from other [full nodes](#fullnodes).
- Transactions in the mempool of a validator are added from the JSON-RPC Service
  of the current node and from the mempool of other Aptos nodes.
- When the current validator is the leader, its consensus component pulls the
  transactions from its mempool and proposes the order of the transactions that
  form a block. The validator quorum then votes on the proposal.

### Merkle Trees

- **Merkle tree** is a type of authenticated data structure that allows for
  efficient verification of data integrity and updates.
- The Aptos network treats the entire blockchain as a single data structure that
  records the history of transactions and states over time.
- The [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) implementation
  simplifies the work of apps accessing the blockchain. It allows apps to:
  - Read any data from any point in time.
  - Verify the integrity of the data using a unified framework.

### Merkle Accumulator

- The **[Merkle Accumulator](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec09/tech/full_papers/crosby.pdf)**
  is an _append-only_ Merkle tree that the Aptos blockchain uses to store the
  ledger.
- A Merkle accumulator can provide proofs that a transaction was included in the
  chain ("proof of inclusion").
- They are also called "history trees" in literature.

### Module

- A **module** in the Move programming language may either be a program or
  library that can create, transfer, or store assets.

### Move

- **Move** is a new programming language that implements all the transactions on
  the Aptos blockchain.
- It has two different kinds of code
  &mdash; [Move scripts](#move-script)
  and [Move modules](#move-module).
- Move is a safe and secure programming language for web3 that emphasizes access
  control and scarcity. It is the programming language used to build the Aptos
  blockchain. You can read more about it
  in [Move on Aptos](blockchain/move.mdx). { /* TODO add move-on-aptos landing page */}

### Move Bytecode

- Move programs are compiled into **Move bytecode**.
- Move bytecode is used to express Move scripts and Move modules.

### Move Module

- A **Move module** defines the rules for updating the global state of the Aptos
  blockchain.
- In the Aptos protocol, a Move module is a **smart contract**.
- Each user-submitted transaction includes a Move script. The Move script
  invokes procedures of one or more Move modules to update the global state of
  the blockchain according to the rules.

### Move Resources

- **Move resources** contain data that can be accessed according to the *
  *procedures** declared in a Move **module.**
- Move resources can never be copied, reused, or lost. This protects Move
  programmers from accidentally or intentionally losing track of a resource.

### Move Script

- Each transaction submitted by a user includes a **Move script**.
- These transactions, also known as Move scripts, represent the operations a
client submits to a validator.
- The operation could be a request to move coins from user A to user B, or it
could involve interactions with published [Move modules](#move-module) (smart
contracts).
- The Move script is an arbitrary program that interacts with resources
published in the global storage of the Aptos blockchain by calling the
procedures of a module. It encodes the logic for a transaction.
- A single Move script can send funds to multiple recipients and invoke
procedures from several different modules.
- A Move script **is not** stored in the global state and cannot be invoked by
other Move scripts. It is a single-use program.

To see example uses of Move scripts,
follow [Move scripts](../build/smart-contracts/scripts/script-tutorial.mdx).

### Move Virtual Machine (MVM)

- The **Move virtual machine** executes Move scripts written
  in [Move bytecode](#move-bytecode) to produce an execution result. This result
  is used to update the blockchain **state**.
- The virtual machine is part of a [validator](#validator).
- The Move virtual machine (MoveVM) processes each validator node that
  translates transactions along with the current blockchain ledger state to
  produce a changeset as input or storage delta as output.

## N

### Node

- A **node** is a peer entity of the Aptos network that tracks the state of the
  Aptos blockchain.
- An Aptos node consists of logical
  components. [Mempool](#mempool), [consensus](#consensus), and
  the [Move virtual machine](#move-virtual-machine-mvm) are examples of node
  components.

### Nonce

- **Nonce** is a number only used once, a random or semi-random number that is
  generated for a specific use for authentication protocols and cryptographic
  hash functions.

## O

### Octa

- An **Octa** is the smallest unit of [APT](#apt). 1 APT = 10<sup>8</sup> Octas.

### Open-Source Community

- **Open-source community** is a term used for a group of developers who work on
  open-source software. If you're reading this glossary, then you are part of
  the Aptos project's developer community.

## P

### Proof

- A **proof** is a way to verify the accuracy of data in the blockchain.
- Every operation in the Aptos blockchain can be verified cryptographically that
  it is indeed correct and that data has not been omitted.
- For example, if a user queries the information within a particular executed
  transaction, they will be provided with a cryptographic proof that the data
  returned to them is correct.

### Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

**Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** is a security mechanism that serves in confirming the
uniqueness and legitimacy of blockchain transactions. The PoS consensus
mechanism is leveraged by the Aptos blockchain powered by a network of
validators, which in turn update the system and process transactions.

## Q

### Quorum Store
- **Quorum Store** is the component that disseminates transactions (in batches) within the validator set.
- It significantly improves consensus throughput by removing the leader bottleneck.
- It decouples data dissemination from metadata ordering, allowing validators to disseminate data asynchronously in parallel.
- More details can be found in the [blog post](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/quorum-store-how-consensus-horizontally-scales-on-the-aptos-blockchain-988866f6d5b0)

## R

### Randapp

- A [dapp](#dapps) that uses randomness for its functionality.

### Resource Account

- A **resource account** is used to manage resources independent of an account
  managed by a user. For example, a developer may use a resource account to
  manage an account for module publishing, say managing a contract.

- The contract itself does not require a signer post initialization. A resource
  account gives you the means for the module to provide a signer to other
  modules and sign transactions on behalf of the module.

See [Resource accounts](../build/smart-contracts/resource-accounts.mdx) for
instructions on use.

### REST API Service

- The **REST API Service** component is the external interface of an Aptos node. Any
  incoming client request, such as submitted transactions or queries, must first
  go through the REST Service. A client needs to go through the REST Service
  component to access storage or any other component in the system. This filters
  requests and protects the system.
- Whenever a client submits a new transaction, the REST Service passes it
  to [mempool](#mempool).

### Round

- A **round** consists of achieving consensus on a block of transactions and
  their execution results.

### Round Number

- A **round number** is a shared counter used to select leaders during
  an [epoch](#epoch) of the consensus protocol.

## S

### SDKs

- Aptos **software development kits (SDKs)** are sets of tools that enable a
  developer to quickly create a custom app on the Aptos platform. Find out more
  at [Use the Aptos SDKs](../build/sdks.mdx).

### Sequence Number

- The **sequence number** for an account indicates the number of transactions
  that have been submitted and committed on chain from that account. It is
  incremented every time a transaction sent from that account is executed or
  aborted and stored in the blockchain.
- A transaction is executed only if it matches the current sequence number for
  the sender account. This helps sequence multiple transactions from the same
  sender and prevents replay attacks.
- If the current sequence number of an account A is X, then a transaction T on
  account A will only be executed if T's sequence number is X.
- These transactions will be held in mempool until they are the next sequence
  number for that account (or until they expire).
- When the transaction is applied, the sequence number of the account will
  become X+1. The account has a strictly increasing sequence number.

### Sender

- _Alternate name_: Sender address.
- **Sender** is the address that originates the transaction. A transaction must
  be signed by the sender but can have more than one signer.

### Shoal

- Method for decreasing latency for BFT protocols.
  See the [Shoal paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03058.pdf)

### Smart Contract

- **Smart contract** refers to a computer program that automatically and
  directly carries out the contract's terms.
- See [Move Module](#move-module) for related details.

### State

- A **state** in the Aptos protocol is a snapshot of the distributed database.
- A transaction modifies the database and produces a new and updated state.

### State Root Hash

- **State root hash** is
  a [Merkle hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) over all keys and
  values the state of the Aptos blockchain at a given version.

## T

### Table

- A [**table**](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-stdlib/doc/table.md)
  implements the Table type and in Aptos is used to store information as
  key-value data within an account at large scale.

See [`table.move`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-stdlib/sources/table.move)
for the associated Aptos source file.

### Testnet

- **Testnet** describes the Aptos network that is not fully functional yet more
  stable than devnet; it is an alternative network to mainnet to be used for
  testing.

### Tokens

- **Tokens** are digital units of value issued on a blockchain. They can be
  redeemed for assets or value held. Tokens can be of the types: Fungible
  Token (FT), Non-Fungible Token (NFT), and Semi-Fungible Token (SFT).

### Transaction

- A raw **transaction** contains the following fields:
  - [Sender (account address)](#account-address)
  - [Move script](#move-script)
  - [Gas price](#gas-unit-price)
  - [Maximum gas amount](#maximum-gas-amount)
  - [Sequence number](#sequence-number)
  - [Expiration time](#expiration-time)
- A signed transaction is a raw transaction with the digital signature.
- An executed transaction changes the state of the Aptos blockchain.

### Transaction Script

- See [Move script](#move-script)

## V

### Validator

- _Alternate name_: Validators.
- A **validator** is an entity of the Aptos ecosystem that validates on the
  Aptos blockchain. It receives requests from clients and runs consensus,
  execution, and storage.
- A validator maintains the history of all the transactions on the blockchain.
- Internally, a validator needs to keep the current state, to execute
  transactions, and to calculate the next state.
- Aptos validators are in charge of verifying transactions.

### Validator Nodes

- **Validator nodes** are a unique class of fullnodes that take part in
  consensus, specifically a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol
  in Aptos. Validators agree upon transactions to be added to the Aptos
  blockchain as well as the order in which they are added.

### Version

- A **version** is a sequentially increasing number that increments for
  every [transaction](#transaction).
- On aptos, transactions are globally ordered and every transaction has a
  version (often called "height" in blockchain literature.)
- Transaction version 0 is the first transaction (genesis transaction), and a
  transaction version 100 is the 101st transaction in the blockchain.

## W

### Well-Formed Transaction

An Aptos transaction is **well-formed** if each of the following conditions are
true for the transaction:

- The transaction has a valid signature.
- An account exists at the sender address.
- It includes a public key, and the hash of the public key matches the sender
  account's authentication key.
- The sequence number of the transaction matches the sender account's sequence
  number.
- The sender account's balance is greater than
  the [maximum gas amount](#maximum-gas-amount).
- The expiration time of the transaction has not passed.
