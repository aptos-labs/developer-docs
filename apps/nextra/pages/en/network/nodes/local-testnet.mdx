# Develop with Local Testnet

## Recommended

Most developers should use the CLI to run a local development network. It is simpler and more fully featured than just a single node local testnet + faucet. If you want a local stack that works just like a production network ([Node API](../aptos-api-spec.md) + [Transaction Stream](../../indexer/txn-stream/index.md) + [Indexer API](../../indexer/api/index.md) + Faucet), this is the option for you.

## Specialized

If you're developing the core Aptos node software itself or have complex testing needs, consider these guides.

- ### [Run a Local Testnet with Validator](./local-testnet/run-a-local-testnet.mdx)
- ### [Run a Local Multi-node Network](./local-testnet/running-a-local-multi-node-network.mdx)
