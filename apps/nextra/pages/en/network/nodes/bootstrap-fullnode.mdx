# Bootstrap a Node with historical data

Bootstrapping a new node usually only depends on [state sync](configure/state-sync.mdx) in its fast sync mode, which synchronizes to a recent state with help from its peers and start syncing recent ledger history from there. However, if longer ledger history is needed for any reason, we have these choices:

- ### [Bootstrap from a Snapshot](bootstrap-fullnode/bootstrap-fullnode.mdx)
- ### [Bootstrap from a Backup](bootstrap-fullnode/aptos-db-restore.mdx)
