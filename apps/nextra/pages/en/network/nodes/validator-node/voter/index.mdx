# Staking Pool Voter

If you are a [staking pool](../../../concepts/staking.md) voter, then we recommend strongly that you do not store your Aptos voter keys with a
custodian before the custodian supports this function. Until then, we suggest you store your voter keys in an Aptos
wallet like [Petra](https://petra.app/).

This document describes how to perform staking voter operations while in the Aptos mainnet using an Aptos wallet.

### Using Governance UI

To participate as a voter in the Aptos governance, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Proposals section](https://governance.aptosfoundation.org/) of the Aptos Governance page.
2. Connect your wallet by clicking on **CONNECT WALLET** (top-right).
3. Make sure that wallet is set to connect to Mainnet.
4. View the proposals. When you are ready to vote on a proposal, click on the proposal and vote.
5. You will see a green bar indicating that the voting transaction is successful.

### Using the Aptos CLI

1. Get your stake pool info using: `aptos node get-stake-pool --owner-address <owner-address> --url <REST API for the network>`.
2. To see the list of proposals, execute: `aptos governance list-proposals --url https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com`.
3. To set up your voter profile, run: `aptos init`.
4. To vote on a proposal, execute: `aptos governance vote --proposal-id <PROPOSAL_ID> --pool-address <POOL_ADDRESS> --url <URL> --profile <profile>`.

## Delegation Pool Voter

If you staked to a [delegation pool](../../../concepts/delegated-staking.md), you can vote proportional to your stake amount in the delegation pool or delegate your votes to another voter address.

To participate as a voter, follow the steps below:

1. Get your delegation pool address from the [Aptos Explorer page](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/validators/delegation?network=mainnet).
2. To see the list of proposals, execute: `aptos governance list-proposals --url https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com`.
3. To set up your voter profile, run: `aptos init`.
4. To vote on a proposal, execute: `aptos move run --function-id 0x1::delegation_pool::vote --args address:<pool-address> u64:<proposal-id> u64:<voting-power> bool:<true or false>`.

To delegate your voting power, follow the steps below:

1. Get your delegation pool address from the [Aptos Explorer page](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/validators/delegation?network=mainnet).
2. To set up your voter profile, run: `aptos init`.
3. To delegate voting power, run: `aptos move run --function-id 0x1::delegation_pool::delegate_voting_power --args address:<pool-address> address:<delegated-voter-address>`.
