# Using GCP

This is a step-by-step guide to deploy an Aptos validator and validator fullnode (VFN) using Google Cloud Platform Services (GCP).
Using this guide, the validator and VFN will be deployed on separate machines.

<Callout type="warning">
**Prerequisites** <br />
Before you begin, make sure to read and understand the [Node Requirements](../node-requirements.mdx). Similarly, make sure you have
installed the [Aptos CLI](../../../../build/cli.mdx),
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html),
[Kubernetes CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/),
and [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk). This guide assumes that you already have a GCP
account setup, and have created a new project for deploying your nodes.
</Callout>

## Deployment steps

1. Create a working directory for your Aptos nodes, and pick a username for your nodes, e.g.,

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   export WORKSPACE=mainnet
   export USERNAME=alice
   mkdir ~/$WORKSPACE
   cd ~/$WORKSPACE
   ```

2. Create a storage bucket for storing the Terraform state on Google Cloud Storage.
   <Callout type="warning">
   **Storage bucket name**<br />
   The name of the Google Cloud storage bucket must be unique.
   See the Google Cloud Storage documentation, [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets#prereq-cli).
   </Callout>

   Use the GCP UI or Google Cloud Storage command to create the bucket:

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   gsutil mb gs://BUCKET_NAME

   # Here's an example of creating a bucket
   gsutil mb gs://<project-name>-aptos-terraform-dev
   ```

3. Create a Terraform file called `main.tf` in your working directory:

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   cd ~/$WORKSPACE
   vi main.tf
   ```

4. Modify the `main.tf` file to configure Terraform and create the Terraform module. See the example below:

   ```terraform filename="main.tf"
   terraform {
     required_version = "~> 1.3.6"
     backend "gcs" {
       bucket = "BUCKET_NAME" # The bucket name created above
       prefix = "state/aptos-node"
     }
   }

   module "aptos-node" {
     # Download the Terraform module from the aptos-core repository.
     source        = "github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git//terraform/aptos-node/gcp"
     region        = "us-central1"  # Specify the GCP region
     zone          = "c"            # Specify the zone suffix
     project       = "<GCP Project ID>" # Specify your GCP project ID
     era           = 1  # Bump the era number to wipe the chain data
     chain_id      = 1  # Use 1 for mainnet, or different values for other networks.
     image_tag     = "mainnet" # Specify the image tag to use based on the network
     validator_name = "<Name of your validator>" # Specify the name of your validator
   }
   ```

   For all customization options, see:

   - The Terraform variables: [https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/terraform/aptos-node/gcp/variables.tf](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/terraform/aptos-node/gcp/variables.tf)
   - The Helm values: [https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/terraform/helm/aptos-node/values.yaml](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/terraform/helm/aptos-node/values.yaml).

5. Initialize Terraform in the `$WORKSPACE` directory where you created the `main.tf` file.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   terraform init
   ```

   This will download all the Terraform dependencies into the `.terraform` folder in your current working directory.

6. Create a new Terraform workspace to isolate your environments, and see the list of workspaces.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   terraform workspace new $WORKSPACE

   # This command will list all workspaces
   terraform workspace list
   ```

7. Apply the Terraform configuration.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   terraform apply
   ```

   This may take a while to finish (e.g., >20 minutes). Terraform will create all the resources on your cloud account.

8. After `terraform apply` finishes, you can check if the resources have been created correctly, by running the following commands:

   - `gcloud container clusters get-credentials aptos-$WORKSPACE --zone <region/zone> --project <project>`: This command will configure access for your k8s cluster.
   - `kubectl get pods`: This command will output all pods in the cluster. You should see haproxy, the
     validator and the VFN (with the validator and VFN pod `pending` due to further action in later steps).
   - `kubectl get svc`: This command will output all services in the cluster. You should see the
     `validator-lb` and `fullnode-lb`, with an external IP for network connectivity.

9. Next, we need to inject your node's IP information into your environment. You can do this by running the following commands:

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   export VALIDATOR_ADDRESS="$(kubectl get svc ${WORKSPACE}-aptos-node-0-validator-lb --output jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')"

   export FULLNODE_ADDRESS="$(kubectl get svc ${WORKSPACE}-aptos-node-0-fullnode-lb --output jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')"
   ```

10. Now, generate the key pairs for your nodes in your working directory. You can do this by running
    the following command with the Aptos CLI:

    ```bash filename="Terminal"
    aptos genesis generate-keys --output-dir ~/$WORKSPACE/keys
    ```

    This will create 4 key files under `~/$WORKSPACE/keys` directory:

    - `public-keys.yaml`: This file contains all public keys for your validator and VFN, as well as your account address.
    - `private-keys.yaml`: This file contains all private keys for your validator and VFN.
    - `validator-identity.yaml`: This file contains the public and private keys for your validator, as well as your account address.
    - `validator-full-node-identity.yaml`: This file contains the public and private keys for your VFN, as well as your account address.

    <Callout type="warning">
    **Backup your private keys**<br />
    Your private keys are important for you to establish ownership of your nodes. Never share your **private** keys with anyone,
    and make sure to **backup** `private-keys.yaml` somewhere safe.
    </Callout>

11. Next, you will need to set your validator configuration. This includes setting the validator and VFN host names,
    which may be IP addresses or DNS addresses. This can be done by running the following command:

    ```bash filename="Terminal"
    aptos genesis set-validator-configuration \
      --local-repository-dir ~/$WORKSPACE \
      --username $USERNAME \
      --owner-public-identity-file ~/$WORKSPACE/keys/public-keys.yaml \
      --validator-host $VALIDATOR_ADDRESS:6180 \
      --full-node-host $FULLNODE_ADDRESS:6182 \
      --stake-amount 100000000000000

    ```

    Configuring the validator will create two YAML files in the `~/$WORKSPACE/$USERNAME` directory: `owner.yaml` and
    `operator.yaml`. These will be useful for connecting your nodes to the Aptos network (later).

12. Download the following files by following the instructions on the [Node Files](../../configure/node-files-all-networks.mdx) pages.
    You will need to select the appropriate network (e.g., `mainnet`, `testnet`, `devnet`) and download the following files:

    - `genesis.blob`
    - `waypoint.txt`

13. To recap, in your working directory (`~/$WORKSPACE`), you should have a list of files:

    - `main.tf`: The Terraform files to install the `aptos-node` module.
    - `keys` folder containing:
      - `public-keys.yaml`: Public keys for both nodes.
      - `private-keys.yaml`: Private keys for both nodes.
      - `validator-identity.yaml`: Key and account information for the validator.
      - `validator-full-node-identity.yaml`: Key and account information for the VFN.
    - `$username` folder containing:
      - `owner.yaml`: The owner, operator and voter mappings.
      - `operator.yaml`: Validator and VFN operator information.
    - `waypoint.txt`: The waypoint for the genesis transaction on the network you are connecting to.
    - `genesis.blob` The genesis blob for the network you are connecting to.

14. Finally, insert the `genesis.blob`, `waypoint.txt` and the identity files as secrets into the k8s cluster,
    by running the following command:

    ```bash filename="Terminal"
    kubectl create secret generic ${WORKSPACE}-aptos-node-0-genesis-e1 \
        --from-file=genesis.blob=genesis.blob \
        --from-file=waypoint.txt=waypoint.txt \
        --from-file=validator-identity.yaml=keys/validator-identity.yaml \
        --from-file=validator-full-node-identity.yaml=keys/validator-full-node-identity.yaml
    ```

    <Callout type="warning">
    **Era numbers and dangling volumes** <br />
    The `-e1` suffix in the command above refers to the era number. If you changed the `era` number, make sure it matches
    when creating the secrets.

    The `era` is a concept relevant only to Kubernetes deployments of an Aptos node.
    Changing the `era` provides an easy way to wipe your deployment's state (e.g., blockchain data). However, this may
    lead to dangling persistent volumes. Confirm the existence of any dangling volumes with `kubectl get pvc`
    and delete any dangling volumes manually to minimize costs.
    </Callout>

15. Now, we should be able to see that all pods are running, including the validator and VFN. You can check this by
    executing the following command:

    ```bash filename="Terminal"
    kubectl get pods

    # Example output
    NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    node1-aptos-node-0-fullnode-e9-0              1/1     Running   0          4h31m
    node1-aptos-node-0-haproxy-7cc4c5f74c-l4l6n   1/1     Running   0          4h40m
    node1-aptos-node-0-validator-0                1/1     Running   0          4h30m
    ```

<Callout type="warning">
**Next steps** <br />
You have now completed setting up your validator and VFN using GCP. However, your nodes will not be able to connect
to the Aptos network just yet.
</Callout>

## Connecting to the Aptos Network

You have now completed setting up your validator and VFN using GCP. Proceed to [Connect Nodes](../connect-nodes.mdx) for the next steps.
