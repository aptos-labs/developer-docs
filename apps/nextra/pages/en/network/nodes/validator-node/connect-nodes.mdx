# Connect Nodes

<Callout type="warning">
**Node deployment** <br />
Before you can connect your nodes to the Aptos network, you will need to deploy them. Make sure to have
deployed your nodes using one of the [deployment methods](deploy-nodes.mdx) before proceeding.
</Callout>

Once you have deployed your validator and validator fullnode (VFN), you will need to
connect them to the Aptos network. This requires initializing your staking pool, joining the validator set,
updating your identity files, and bootstrapping your nodes. If you do not complete these steps, your nodes
will not be able to connect to other nodes in the network.

Follow the [Connect to a Network](connect-nodes/connect-to-aptos-network.mdx) guide to get started.
