# Rotate consensus key

Consensus key rotation is an action taken by a node operator to change the identity of a validator they control.
It happens typically when the corresponding private key is (potentially) lost/leaked,
or every few months as a common security practice.

Below is the step-by-step guide of performing a consensus key rotation with detailed examples.

## New key generation

Using the following [Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/en/build/cli) command to generate a new consensus identity.
In this example, identity files are saved to directory `/new/key/root`.
```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos genesis generate-keys --output-dir /new/key/root
```

## Add new private key to node

Edit the node config yaml as described below.
```yaml
# ...
consensus:
    # ...
    safety_rules:
        # ...
        initial_safety_rules_config:
            from_file:
                # ...
                identity_blob_path: /old/key/root/validator-identity.yaml
                overriding_identity_paths:              # new!
                - /new/key/root/validator-identity.yaml # new!
```
<Callout type="info">
* Field `identity_blob_path` is required.
* Field `overriding_identity_paths` is optional, and allows multiple identities to be specified for rotation purposes.
* The node will choose the identity that matches the on-chain state.
</Callout>

Now restart the node.
It should load the new key but continue using the old key for consensus.

## Add new public key on chain

Aptos CLI is needed again, and your operator account is assumed to have been set up as a CLI profile `profile1`.

Find your pool address (denoted by `$POOL_ADDR`).

In `/new/key/root/public-keys.yaml`,
- find the public key of your new consensus identity  (denoted by `$NEW_PUBLIC_KEY`);
- find the proof of possession of your new consensus identity (denoted by `$PROOF_OF_POSSESSION`).

Run a transaction with aptos CLI to update the on-chain consensus public key for the next epoch.
```bash
aptos move run \
    --profile profile1 \
    --function-id 0x1::stake::rotate_consensus_key \
    --args \
        address:$POOL_ADDR \
        hex:$NEW_PUBLIC_KEY \
        hex:$PROOF_OF_POSSESSION
```

Here is a complete example.
```bash
aptos move run \
    --profile profile1 \
    --function-id 0x1::stake::rotate_consensus_key \
    --args \
        address:0x1eb42885d7d5232269229e56bb80d0959584e14485097ebf9ab619cf4fda5c02 \
        hex:0xacb7859468ca85cf9935e64ebb2b9b3fa8187de42d541acebaf732365a0131eaa994098f9d0d7e6b8ddea8ef11e16c55 \
        hex:0x8e27fd9300433191b1123217928a6f5190a6ec344ea8623555712a850029b34f5c4bab68df7568b48bcced408cde5174064284407ee760df5dbf12d1c6090589ea1a692997018aca740e91d2182e5715c7745565fe99361e279ccfcfa10ae1f7
```

## Wait for the next epoch

The new key should become effective after the next epoch change (which happens every 2 hours).

## (Advanced) Old key clean-up

In the secure storage (typically a file named `secure_storage.json`),
consensus identities are organized as follows.
- Field `consensus` contains the default consensus identity.
  - Typically created when you start the node for the first time.
  - Must exist.
- Field `consensus_X` contains additional consensus identities with `X` as its public key.
  - Created because you once added it to `overriding_identity_paths` in node config yaml.


**Currently, identities won't be deleted automatically from secure storage**,
even if you delete the corresponding identity from the node config yaml.

If you need to ensure the old key is completely gone, manually clean-up is needed.

Here is an example of `secure_storage.json`.
```js
{
    // ...
    "consensus": {
        "data": "GetResponse",
        "last_update": 1731372563,
        "value": "0x221f6fbfefa0a40b84c88fbb546a0884977dcc56719a96ed4e5d69b6a4ff58c8"
    },
    "consensus_acb7859468ca85cf9935e64ebb2b9b3fa8187de42d541acebaf732365a0131eaa994098f9d0d7e6b8ddea8ef11e16c55": {
        "data": "GetResponse",
        "last_update": 1731383387,
        "value": "0x18d5098b3819d5fb0fc208b8bb0946b263f961f60716fc4d10d4b010fdb89a55"
    },
    // ...
}
```

To delete private key `0x18d5...`, simply delete the entire field with key `consensus_acb7...`.

To delete private key `0x221f...`, update the value `0x221f...` to something else (e.g. another private key).
