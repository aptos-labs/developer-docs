# Operator

If you are an operator participating in the Aptos network, then use this document to perform the operator tasks such as deploying a validator node and validator fullnode, registering the nodes on the Aptos community platform, and performing the validation.

<Callout type="info">
**Both validator node and validator fullnode are required for mainnet** <br />
For participating in the Aptos mainnet, you must deploy both a validator node and a validator fullnode.
</Callout>

## Deploy the nodes and register

<Steps>

### Read the [Node Requirements](node-requirements.mdx)

Make sure that your hardware, storage and network resources satisfy the node requirements.

### Deploy the nodes

Follow the detailed node installation steps provided in [**Running Validator Node**](deploy-nodes.mdx) 
and deploy a validator node and a validator fullnode.

</Steps>

Note that your nodes will not be running correctly (not syncing, not participating in consensus), 
until they're added to the validator set via [staking pool operations](connect-nodes/staking-pool-operations.mdx) (below).

## Connect to Aptos network

After deploying your nodes, [connect to the Aptos Network](connect-nodes/connect-to-aptos-network.mdx).

## Set up staking and delegation pool operations

After connecting your nodes to the Aptos network, establish [staking pool operations](connect-nodes/staking-pool-operations.mdx) to add your node to the validator set.

Similarly, conduct [delegation pool operations](connect-nodes/delegation-pool-operations.mdx) for APT delegated to your validator. Your node will start syncing and participating in consensus.

## Ensure your nodes are live

After your nodes are deployed and configure, make sure they meet [node liveness criteria](verify-nodes/node-liveness-criteria.mdx).
