# Develop with Localnet

## Recommended

Most developers should use the CLI to run a local development network.
It is simpler and more fully featured than just a single node localnet + faucet.
If you want a local stack that works just like a production network
([Node API](../../build/apis.mdx) + [Transaction Stream](../../build/indexer/txn-stream.mdx) +
[Indexer API](../../build/indexer.mdx) + Faucet), this is the option for you.

## Specialized

If you're developing the core Aptos node software itself or have complex testing needs, consider this guide.

- ### [Run a Localnet with Validator](localnet/run-a-localnet.mdx)
{/* - ### [Run a Local Multi-node Network](./localnet/running-a-local-multi-node-network.mdx) */}
