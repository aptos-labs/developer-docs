title: "Important Node Metrics"
---

When you visit the metrics endpoint (see [Node Inspection Service](./node-inspection-service.md)), you will notice that
there are a large number of metrics and counters being produced by your node. Most of these metrics and counters are
useful only for blockchain development and diagnosing hard-to-find issues. As a result, we recommend that node
operators ignore most metrics and pay attention to only the key metrics presented below:

:::caution Metric instability
As Aptos continues to grow and develop the blockchain software, many metrics will come and go.
As a result, we recommend relying on the presence of only the metrics explicitly mentioned below.
All other metrics should be considered unstable and may be changed/removed without warning.

### Consensus

If you are running a validator node, the following
[consensus](../../concepts/blockchain.md#consensus) metrics are important:

1. `aptos_consensus_proposals_count`: Counts the number of times the node sent a block
   proposal to the network. The count will increase only when the validator is chosen to be a proposer,
   which depends on the node's stake and leader election reputation. You should expect this metric to
   increase at least once per hour.
2. `aptos_consensus_last_committed_round`: Counts the last committed round of the node.
   During consensus, we expect this value to increase once per consensus round, which should be multiple
   times per second. If this does not happen, it is likely the node is not participating in consensus.
3. `aptos_consensus_timeout_count`: Counts the number of times the node locally timed out while trying
   to participate in consensus. If this counter increases, it is likely the node is not participating
   in consensus and may be having issues, e.g., network difficulties.
4. `aptos_state_sync_executing_component_counters{label="consensus"`: This counter increases
   a few times per second as long as the node is participating in consensus. When this counter stops
   increasing, it means the node is not participating in consensus, and has likely fallen back to state
   synchronization (e.g., because it fell behind the rest of the validators and needs to catch up).

### State sync

If you are running a fullnode (or a validator that still needs to synchronize to the latest blockchain
state), the following [state sync](../../guides/state-sync.md) metrics are important:

1. `aptos_state_sync_version{type="synced"}`: This metric displays the current synced version of the node,
   i.e., the number of transactions the node has processed. If this metric stops increasing, it means the
   node is not syncing. Likewise, if this metric doesn't increase faster than the rate at which new transactions
   are committed to the blockchain, it means the node is unlikely to get and stay up-to-date with the rest of
   the network. Note: if you've selected to use [fast sync](../../guides/state-sync.md#fast-syncing),
   this metric won't increase until all states have been downloaded, which may take some time. See (3) below.
2. `aptos_data_client_highest_advertised_data{data_type="transactions"}`: This metric displays the highest
   version synced and advertised by the peers that your node is connected to. As a result, when this metric is
   higher than `aptos_state_sync_version{type="synced"}` (above) it means your node can see new blockchain data and
   will sync the data from its peers.
3. `aptos_state_sync_version{type="synced_states"}`: This metric counts the number of states that have been
   downloaded while a node is [fast syncing](../../guides/state-sync.md#fast-syncing). If this metric doesn't increase,
   and `aptos_state_sync_version{type="synced"}` doesn't increase (from above), it means the node is not syncing
   at all and an issue has likely occurred.
4. `aptos_state_sync_bootstrapper_errors` and `aptos_state_sync_continuous_syncer_errors`: If your node is
   facing issues syncing (or is seeing transient failures), these metrics will increase each time an error occurs.
   The `error_label` inside these metrics will display the error type.

:::tip
Compare the synced version shown by `aptos_state_sync_version{type="synced"}` with the highest version shown on the [Aptos Explorer](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/?network=mainnet) to see how far behind the latest blockchain version your node is. Remember to select the correct network that your node is syncing to (e.g., `mainnet`).

### Networking

The following network metrics are important, for both validators and fullnodes:

1. `aptos_connections{direction="inbound"` and `aptos_connections{direction="outbound"`: These metrics count
   the number of peers your node is connected to, as well as the direction of the network connection. An `inbound`
   connection means that a peer (e.g., another fullnode) has connected to you. An `outbound` connection means that
   your node has connected to another node (e.g., connected to a validator fullnode).
   1. If your node is a validator, the sum of both `inbound` and `outbound` connections should be equal to the
      number of other validators in the network. Note that only the sum of these connections matter. If all connections
      are `inbound`, or all are `outbound`, this doesn't matter.
   2. If your node is a fullnode, the number of `outbound` connections should be `> 0`. This will ensure your node is
      able to synchronize. Note that the number of `inbound` connections matters only if you want to act as a seed in
      the network and allow other nodes to connect to you as discussed
      [Fullnode Network Connections](../../nodes/full-node/fullnode-network-connections.md#allowing-pfn-connections).

### Mempool

The following [mempool](../../concepts/blockchain.md#mempool) metrics are important:

1. `core_mempool_index_size{index="system_ttl"`: This metric displays the number of transactions currently sitting in
   the mempool of the node and waiting to be committed to the blockchain:
   1. If your node is a fullnode, it's highly unlikely that this metric will be `> 0`, unless transactions are actively
      being sent to your node via the REST API and/or other fullnodes that have connected to you. Most fullnode operators
      should ignore this metric.
   2. If your node is a validator, you can use this metric to see if transactions from your node's mempool are being
      included in the blockchain (e.g., if the count decreases). Likewise, if this metric only increases, it means
      that either: (i) your node is unable to forward transactions to other validators to be included in the blockchain; or
      (ii) that the entire blockchain is under heavy load and may soon become congested.

### REST API

The following [REST API](https://aptos.dev/nodes/aptos-api-spec) metrics are important:

1. `aptos_api_requests_count{method="GET"` and `aptos_api_requests_count{method="POST"`: These metrics count
   the number of REST API `GET` and `POST` requests that have been received via the node's REST API. This
   allows you to monitor and track the amount of REST API traffic on your node. You can also further use the
   `operation_id` in the metric to monitor the types of operations the requests are performing.

2. `aptos_api_response_status_count`: This metric counts the number of response types that were sent for
   the REST API. For example, `aptos_api_response_status_count{status="200"}` counts the number of requests
   that were successfully handled with a `200` response code. You can use this metric to track the success and
   failure rate of the REST API traffic.
