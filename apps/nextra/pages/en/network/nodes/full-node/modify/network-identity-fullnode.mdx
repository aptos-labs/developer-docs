# Generate a PFN Identity

<Callout type="warning">
Validators and VFNs have their identities initialized when first created and their identities are long-lived (immutable).
PFN identities are more ephemeral and can be regenerated on demand. As such, generating an identity using this
guide **should only be done for PFNs**, and not for validators or VFNs.
</Callout>

## Ephemeral vs. Static Identities
Public fullnodes (PFNs) will automatically start up with a randomly generated (ephemeral) network identity unless a static identity is provided. This works well for
regular PFNs. However, there are cases where you may want to generate and assign a static network identity to your PFN.

### Ephemeral Identity

- Automatically generated on startup. The same ephemeral identity is used across restarts if the identity key file already exists.
- Stored at `/opt/aptos/data/db/ephemeral_identity_key`.

### Static Identity
This is useful when:
- You wish to advertise your PFN as a seed (i.e., for other Aptos PFNs to connect to).
- You wish to add your PFN to an allowlist of known identities on an upstream PFN or VFN.
- You wish to fix the identity of your PFN across restarts and releases so that telemetry and other monitoring tools can track your PFN over time.

<Callout type="warning">
Before you proceed, make sure that you already know how to start your local PFN. See [Run a PFN](../../full-node.mdx) for detailed documentation.
</Callout>

## Generate a static identity

To create a static identity for your PFN, you will first need to generate a private and public key pair. You will then
need to derive the `peer_id` from the public key, and use the `peer_id` in your configuration file
(e.g., `fullnode.yaml`) to configure the static network identity for your PFN.

The steps below will guide you through the process of generating a static identity for your PFN. The exact steps depend
on whether you are using the `aptos-core` source code to run your PFN, or Docker.

### Using the aptos-core source code

If you use the `aptos-core` source code to run your PFN, follow these steps:

1. **Generate the private key**

First, use the [Aptos CLI](../../../../build/cli.mdx) (`aptos`) to produce a hex encoded static
x25519 private key. This will be the private key for your network identity. Run the following `aptos` CLI command:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos key generate --key-type x25519 --output-file /path/to/private-key.txt
```

This command will create a file `private-key.txt` with the private key in it, and a corresponding
`private-key.txt.pub` file with the public key in it. An example `private-key.txt` file and
`private-key.txt.pub` file are shown below:

    ```bash filename="Terminal"
    cat ~/private-key.txt
    C83110913CBE4583F820FABEB7514293624E46862FAE1FD339B923F0CACC647D%

    cat ~/private-key.txt.pub
    B881EA2C174D8211C123E5A91D86227DB116A44BB345A6E66874F83D8993F813%
    ```

2. **Retrieve the peer identity**

Next, retrieve the peer identity from the public key using the `aptos` CLI. The `--host` flag in
the command will provide the host information to output a network address for your PFN. Run the following command
(be sure to update the `--host` flag with your actual host information):

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos key extract-peer --host example.com:6180 \
    --public-network-key-file private-key.txt.pub \
    --output-file peer-info.yaml
```

This command will output the public identity information for your PFN to a file `peer-info.yaml`. For example:

```json
{
  "Result": {
    "B881EA2C174D8211C123E5A91D86227DB116A44BB345A6E66874F83D8993F813": {
      "addresses": [
        "/dns/example.com/tcp/6180/noise-ik/0xB881EA2C174D8211C123E5A91D86227DB116A44BB345A6E66874F83D8993F813/handshake/0"
      ],
      "keys": [
        "0xB881EA2C174D8211C123E5A91D86227DB116A44BB345A6E66874F83D8993F813"
      ],
      "role": "Upstream"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, `B881EA2C174D8211C123E5A91D86227DB116A44BB345A6E66874F83D8993F813` is the `peer_id`.

3. **Start a PFN with the identity**

After extracting the peer identity from the public key, you can start your PFN with the identity using the
public key in the `peer_id` field of the configuration file (e.g., `fullnode.yaml`). For example:

```yaml filename="fullnode.yaml"
full_node_networks:
  - network_id: "public"
discovery_method: "onchain"
identity:
  type: "from_config"
  key: "<PRIVATE_KEY>"
  peer_id: "<PEER_ID>"
```

In our example (from above), the configuration file (`fullnode.yaml`) should now have the following information:

```yaml filename="fullnode.yaml"
full_node_networks:
  - network_id: "public"
    discovery_method: "onchain"
    identity:
      type: "from_config"
      key: "C83110913CBE4583F820FABEB7514293624E46862FAE1FD339B923F0CACC647D"
      peer_id: "B881EA2C174D8211C123E5A91D86227DB116A44BB345A6E66874F83D8993F813"
```

Starting your PFN with this configuration will assign your PFN with the static network identity you generated.

### Using Docker

If you use Docker to run your PFN, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your tools**

First, `cd` into the directory for your local PFN and start a Docker container with the latest tools, for example:

```bash filename="Terminal"
cd ~/my-full-node
docker run -it aptoslabs/tools:devnet /bin/bash
```

2. **Generate the private key**

Next, follow the remaining steps from inside the `aptoslabs/tools` Docker container.

Open a new terminal and `cd` into the directory where you started the Docker container for your PFN. Making
sure to provide the **full path** to where you want the private key file to be stored, run the command:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos key generate \
    --key-type x25519 \
    --output-file /path/to/private-key.txt
```

3. **Retrieve the peer identity**

Next, retrieve the peer identity from the public key using the `aptos` CLI. The `--host` flag in
the command will provide the host information to output a network address for your PFN. Run the following command
(be sure to update the `--host` flag with your actual host information):

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos key extract-peer --host example.com:6180 \
    --public-network-key-file private-key.txt.pub \
    --output-file peer-info.yaml
```

This command will output the public identity information for your PFN to a file `peer-info.yaml`. For example:

```json
{
  "Result": {
    "B881EA2C174D8211C123E5A91D86227DB116A44BB345A6E66874F83D8993F813": {
      "addresses": [
        "/dns/example.com/tcp/6180/noise-ik/0xB881EA2C174D8211C123E5A91D86227DB116A44BB345A6E66874F83D8993F813/handshake/0"
      ],
      "keys": [
        "0xB881EA2C174D8211C123E5A91D86227DB116A44BB345A6E66874F83D8993F813"
      ],
      "role": "Upstream"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, `B881EA2C174D8211C123E5A91D86227DB116A44BB345A6E66874F83D8993F813` is the `peer_id`.

4. **Start a PFN with the identity**

After extracting the peer identity from the public key, you can start your PFN with the identity using the
public key in the `peer_id` field of the configuration file (e.g., `fullnode.yaml`). For example:

```yaml
full_node_networks:
  - network_id: "public"
discovery_method: "onchain"
identity:
  type: "from_config"
  key: "<PRIVATE_KEY>"
  peer_id: "<PEER_ID>"
```

In our example (from above), the configuration file (`fullnode.yaml`) should now have the following information:

```yaml
full_node_networks:
  - network_id: "public"
    discovery_method: "onchain"
    identity:
      type: "from_config"
      key: "C83110913CBE4583F820FABEB7514293624E46862FAE1FD339B923F0CACC647D"
      peer_id: "B881EA2C174D8211C123E5A91D86227DB116A44BB345A6E66874F83D8993F813"
```

Starting your PFN with this configuration will assign your PFN with the static network identity you generated.
