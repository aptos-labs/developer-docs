# Run a Localnet with Validator

<Callout type="info">
**Using the CLI to run a local development network** <br />
Running a localnet with the Aptos CLI is simpler and more fully featured. Learn how by following this guide: [Run a Local Development Network with the CLI](local-development-network.mdx).
</Callout>

You can run a localnet of the Aptos blockchain. This localnet will not be connected to the Aptos devnet. It will run on your local machine, independent of other Aptos networks. You can use this localnet for testing and development purposes.

You can run a localnet using the Aptos-core source code. This approach is useful for testing modifications to the Aptos-core codebase or to the Aptos Framework.

The rest of this document describes:

- How to start your localnet with a single validator node, and
- How to start a Faucet service and attach it to your localnet.

## Using the Aptos-core source code

1. Follow steps in [Building Aptos From Source](../building-from-source.mdx)

2. With your development environment ready, now you can start your localnet. Before you proceed, make a note of the following:

   <Callout type="info">
   **NOTE**
   - When you run the below command to start the localnet, your terminal will enter into an interactive mode, with a message `Aptos is running, press ctrl-c to exit`. Hence, you will need to open another shell terminal for the subsequent steps described in this section.
   - After the below command runs, copy the `Test dir` information from the terminal output for the next step.
   </Callout>

   To start your localnet, run the following command:

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI=true cargo run -p aptos-node -- --test
   ```

   See below for an example of the partial output. Make a note of the `Test dir` from the output.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   ...
   ...
   ...

   Completed generating configuration:

       Test dir: "/private/var/folders/gn/m74t8ylx55z935q8wx035qn80000gn/T/b3adc18c144bfcc78a1541953893bc1c/0/node.yaml"
       Aptos root key path: "/private/var/folders/gn/m74t8ylx55z935q8wx035qn80000gn/T/b3adc18c144bfcc78a1541953893bc1c/mint.key"
       Waypoint: 0:47e676b5fe38ebe2aec6053db7b3daa0b805693d6422e3475e46e89499464ecf
       ChainId: TESTING
       REST API endpoint: 0.0.0.0:8080
       Fullnode network: /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/7180
   Aptos is running, press ctrl-c to exit
   ```

**NOTE**: The above command starts a localnet with a single validator node. The command runs `aptos-node` from a genesis-only ledger state. If you want to reuse the ledger state produced by a previous run of `aptos-node`, then use:

```bash filename="Terminal"
cargo run -p aptos-node -- --test --config <config-path>
```

### Attaching a Faucet to your localnet

Faucets are stateless services that can be run in parallel with the localnet. A Faucet is a way to create Aptos test coins with no real-world value. You can use the Faucet by sending a request to create coins and transfer them into a given account on your behalf.

1. Make sure that you started your localnet as described in Step 5 above.
2. Open a new shell terminal.
3. Copy the _Aptos root key path_ from your terminal where you started the localnet, and use it to replace the `mint-key-file-path` in the below command.
4. Run the following command to start a Faucet:

```bash filename="Terminal"
cargo run --package aptos-faucet-service -- run-simple --key-file-path "/tmp/694173aa3bbe019499bbd5cf3fe0e2fc/mint.key" --node-url http://127.0.0.1:8080 --chain-id TESTING
```

This will start a Faucet running locally without any restrictions to tokens that can be claimed and minted. This Faucet service will be as accessible as the localnet you started above.

## Interacting with the localnet

After starting your localnet, you will see the following:

```bash filename="Terminal"
Entering test mode, this should never be used in production!
Completed generating configuration:
        Log file: "/tmp/694173aa3bbe019499bbd5cf3fe0e2fc/validator.log"
        Test dir: "/tmp/694173aa3bbe019499bbd5cf3fe0e2fc/0/node.yaml"
        Aptos root key path: "/tmp/694173aa3bbe019499bbd5cf3fe0e2fc/mint.key"
        Waypoint: 0:197bc8b76761622c2d2054d8bf93c1802fa0eb4bc55f0f3d4442878fdecc297f
        ChainId: TESTING
        REST API endpoint: 0.0.0.0:8080
        Fullnode network: /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/7180

Aptos is running, press ctrl-c to exit
```

Use the [Aptos CLI tool](../../../build/cli.mdx) to interact with your localnet. The above output contains information you will use for starting the [Aptos CLI tool](../../../build/cli.mdx):

- `Aptos root key path`: The root key (also known as the mint or faucet key) controls the account that can mint tokens. Available in the docker compose folder under `aptos_root_key`.
- `Waypoint`: A verifiable checkpoint of the blockchain (available in the docker compose folder under waypoint.txt)
- `REST endpoint`: The endpoint for the REST service, e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
- `ChainId`: The chain ID uniquely distinguishes this network from other blockchain networks.

## Next steps

At this point, you will have a special root account at `0x1` that can perform the mint operation. Follow up with some tutorials such as on [Aptos Learn workshops](https://learn.aptoslabs.com/en/workshops)
