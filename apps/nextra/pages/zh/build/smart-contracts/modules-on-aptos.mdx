# Modules on Aptos

Aptos allows for permissionless publishing of [modules](book/modules-and-scripts.mdx)
within a [package](book/packages.mdx) as well as [upgrading](book/package-upgrades.mdx)
those that have appropriate compatibility policy set.

A module contains several structs and functions, much like Rust.

During package publishing time, a few constraints are maintained:

- Both Structs and public function signatures are published as immutable.
- Only when a module is being published for the first time, and not during an
upgrade, will the VM search for and execute an `init_module(account: &signer)`
function. The signer of the account that is publishing the module is passed into
the `init_module` function of the contract. **This function must be private and
not return any value.**

<Callout type="info">
`init_module` is optional
It is only necessary if you want to initialize data when publishing a module for the first time.
</Callout>
