# How can I compile Move Scripts?

Move scripts can be compiled with the already existing Aptos Move compiler in
the Aptos CLI. For more on how to install and use the Aptos CLI with Move contracts, go to the [Working With Move Contracts](../../cli/working-with-move-contracts.mdx) page.

Once you have the Aptos CLI installed, you can compile a script by running the following command from within the script package:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos move compile
```

There will then be compiled bytecode files under `build/` with the same name as
the function in Move.

For example this script in package `transfer_half`, would compile
to `build/transfer_half/bytecode_scripts/transfer_half.mv`

```move
script {
  use std::signer;
  use aptos_framework::coin;
  use aptos_framework::aptos_account;

  fun transfer_half<Coin>(caller: &signer, receiver_address: address) {
    // Retrieve the balance of the caller
    let caller_address: address = signer::address_of(caller);
    let balance: u64 = coin::balance<Coin>(caller_address);

    // Send half to the receiver
    let half = balance / 2;
    aptos_account::transfer_coins<Coin>(caller, receiver_address, half);
  }
}
```

Additionally, there is a convenience function for a package with exactly one
script with the below command:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos move compile-script
```

Providing output like below returning the exact location of the script and a
hash for convenience

```bash filename="Terminal"
