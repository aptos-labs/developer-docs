# Exchange Integration Guide

This describes how to integrate Aptos and Aptos assets into an exchange.  It provides
generic information for tracking balances, transferring assets, and testing the integration.

## Overview

This document will guide you through the following tasks to integrate with Aptos:
* Infrastructure
* Address standards
* Asset standards
* Retrieving balances
* Tracking balance changes
* Transferring assets
* Testing the integration

## Infrastructure

It's suggested that you run your own [full node](../../network/nodes/full-node.mdx) to interact with the Aptos blockchain.
This will allow you to query the blockchain for the latest state and submit transactions.
You can also use the [Indexer](../indexer.mdx) to query for on-chain data efficiently.

## Address Standards

### Addresses
A single address can be represented in three ways.  We recommend you show all leading zeros, and the `0x`. Here is an example of all three representations for the framework address `0x1`:
* `0x00000000000000000000000000000001` - A full representation of 32-bytes in hex with a leading `0x`.  This is preferred.
* `0x1` - The short representation of the address with a leading `0x`. This is kept around for compatibility, but preferred with all leading 0s.
* `00000000000000000000000000000001` - A full representation of 32-bytes in hex without a leading `0x`. This is kept around for compatibility, but preferred with leading 0x.

For example SDKs will handle this parsing automatically, and we suggest you use the SDKs directly to handle it for you.

```ts filename="example.ts"
import { AccountAddress } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";
const address = AccountAddress.from("0x1");
address.toStringLong(); // 0x00000000000000000000000000000001
```

There is additionally, Aptos Name Service (ANS) for friendly .apt names.  For more information about addresses
and Aptos Names, see our page on [Accounts](../../network/blockchain/accounts).

## Account Standards

Accounts must exist prior to sending a transaction to the blockchain.  This is done by creating an account resource, which can
be created by simply calling `0x1::aptos_account::transfer` with a zero amount to the account you want to create.  Optionally,
`0x1::aptos_account::create_account` can be used to create an account with a zero balance.

```ts filename="example.ts"
import { Aptos, Ed25519Account, Ed25519PrivateKey } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";

const aptos = new Aptos();
const account = new Ed25519Account({privateKey: new Ed25519PrivateKey("private key")})
const transaction = await aptos.transferCoinTransaction({sender: account.accountAddress, recipient: "receiver address", amount: 100000000})
const pendingTransaction = await aptos.transaction.signAndSubmitTransaction({signer: account, transaction})
const committedTransaction = await aptos.waitForTransaction({transactionHash: pendingTransaction.hash});
```

## Asset Standards

Aptos provides two standards for fungible tokens, similar to ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum:

* An earlier [Coin standard](../smart-contracts/aptos-coin.mdx) used by assets on Aptos.
* A newer [Fungible Asset Standard](../smart-contracts/fungible-asset.mdx) which is more featured.

Additionally, there is a migratory period for assets from Coin to Fungible Asset standards.
We will call this from now on **migrated coins**. Migrated coins may have two forms, but either
can be used interchangeably with Coin standards. This is important to note when querying balances, to
use coin functions and not fungible asset functions. The FA standard can only deal with the FA form.

<Callout type="info">
APT, the native token of Aptos, is a migrated coin.  This means it can be used
with both the Coin and Fungible Asset standards.
</Callout>

### Coin Standard (tl;dr)

A **coin** has an associated contract that holds the on-chain struct that represents the coin.  The coin is
represented as a struct name e.g. `0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin` for `APT`.

All coins are stored in an account resource called `0x1::coin::CoinStore<CoinType>`.  Coins must be registered
prior to using the `CoinStore`, but if using the proper functions e.g. `0x1::aptos_account::transfer`
or `0x1::aptos_account::transfer_coins<CoinType>`, this will be done automatically.

Coins can be *migrated* to a fungible asset.  In order to support a migrated asset,
continue calling the coin functions as will be mentioned later.

More info can be found at: [Coin Standard](../smart-contracts/aptos-coin.mdx)

### Fungible Asset Standard (tl;dr)

A **fungible asset** has an associated metadata address that holds the metadata for the fungible asset.  This is commonly called the
fa metadata address.  The asset is represented as an address e.g. `0xA` for `APT`.

All fungible assets are stored in an `object`, which is called a `fungible asset store`.

For exchanges, the most important store is `primary_fungible_store`, which is the default store for fungible assets.
This is directly connected to an owner. From this point on in this guide, we will
only talk about supporting `primary_fungible_store` for fungible assets.

More info can be found at: [Fungible Asset Standard](../smart-contracts/fungible-asset.mdx)

## Retrieving Balances

Retrieving current balances for assets are different for each standard.  Integration is considered complete when it can handle both.

Balances are always returned in their subunits.  For example, `APT` is returned in `octas` (1e-8 APT).  So, when an API
returns a balance of `100000000`, this is `1 APT`. If it returns `100`, this is `0.000001 APT`.

### Coin (and migrated coins) Balances

<Callout type="info">
  Note: This includes APT and any other coin that was migrated to a fungible
  asset.  If the asset is a migrated coin, use this over fungible asset balance.  The
  fungible asset balance will not include the coin portion of the balance.
</Callout>

To retrieve the balance of a coin, or a coin that was migrated to a fungible asset, you can use
the `0x1::coin::balance<CoinType>(account address)` view function.  This will combine the coin and coin migrated to fungible asset balances.

```ts filename="example.ts"
import { Aptos, AptosConfig, Network } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";

const config = new AptosConfig({ network: Network.DEVNET });
const aptos = new Aptos(config);

const coinType = "0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin";
const account = "0x00000000000000000000000000000001";
const [balanceStr] = await aptos.view<[string]>({
  payload: {
    function: "0x1::coin::balance",
    typeArguments: [coinType],
    functionArguments: [account]
  }
});
const balance = parseInt(balanceStr, 10);
```

A specific ledger version (transaction height) can be provided to get the balance at that point in time.  The below example shows for ledger version `1,000,000`.

```ts filename="example.ts"
import { Aptos, AptosConfig, Network } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";

const config = new AptosConfig({ network: Network.DEVNET });
const aptos = new Aptos(config);

const coinType = "0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin";
const account = "0x00000000000000000000000000000001";
const [balanceStr] = await aptos.view<[string]>({
  payload: {
    function: "0x1::coin::balance",
    typeArguments: [coinType],
    functionArguments: [account],
    options: {
      ledgerVersion: 1_000_000
    }
  }
});
const balance = parseInt(balanceStr, 10);
```

### Fungible Asset Balances

To retrieve the balance of a fungible asset, you can use
the `0x1::primary_fungible_store::balance<0x1::object::ObjectCore>(account address, fungible asset metadata address)` view function.
Note, that this will not include the balance of coins if it's a migrated coin.

```ts filename="example.ts"
import { Aptos, AptosConfig, Network } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";

const config = new AptosConfig({ network: Network.DEVNET });
const aptos = new Aptos(config);

const faMetadataAddress = "0xA";
const account = "0x00000000000000000000000000000001";
const [balanceStr] = await aptos.view<[string]>({
  payload: {
    function: "0x1::primary_fungible_store::balance",
    typeArguments: ["0x1::object::ObjectCore"],
    functionArguments: [account, faMetadataAddress]
  }
});
const balance = parseInt(balanceStr, 10);
```

A specific ledger version (transaction height) can be provided to get the balance at that point in time.  The below example shows for ledger version `1,000,000`.

```ts filename="example.ts"
import { Aptos, AptosConfig, Network } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";

const config = new AptosConfig({ network: Network.DEVNET });
const aptos = new Aptos(config);

const faMetadataAddress = "0xA";
const account = "0x00000000000000000000000000000001";
const [balanceStr] = await aptos.view<[string]>({
  payload: {
    function: "0x1::primary_fungible_store::balance",
    typeArguments: ["0x1::object::ObjectCore"],
    functionArguments: [account, faMetadataAddress]
  },
  options: {
    ledgerVersion: 1_000_000
  }
});
const balance = parseInt(balanceStr, 10);
```

## Tracking Balance Changes

Balance changes can be queried in one of two ways:
1. By watching for events that change the balance for each transaction.
2. By querying the indexer for indexed balance change events.

In the past, it was able to use the `events` endpoint for an account to get the
transactions that changed the balance.  This is still possible, but will be deprecated
in the future, and is not recommended for new integrations.

### Coin Balance Changes

Coin balances are tracked as two items, write set changes, and events.  Write set
changes are end state of the coin balance, and events are the events that are
emitted when a coin is withdrawn or deposited.

Here is an [example of a coin transfer](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/txn/1747361321?network=mainnet).
The coin transfer can be tracked as an individual transaction
[here](https://fullnode.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/transactions/by_version/1747361321)
from the REST API.

We'll break it down into a few parts:

1. The general transaction details tell information about the transaction.  The
most important thing here is the transaction version is `1747361321`.  This gives
us total order of all transactions on the blockchain. Think of it like block
height, but for transactions.
<details>
  <summary>Transaction Details</summary>
  ```json
  {
    "version": "1747361321",
    "hash": "0x7c56ad56c7d02bb11887e535b9f1b221626d5b0d4cb5a1ffbadc358c1db515ea",
    "state_change_hash": "0xc901b5e9e0965201e8205977720d7dea8a3709ee0d818fd5ec752cac13eaf18a",
    "event_root_hash": "0x0077cb7df9db9ee7194c489db177fe9a325bcf3f1309ea99ed934085e5592041",

  }
  ```
</details>
2. The Write set `changes` are the end state of the transaction.  It shows all
resources that were modified by the transaction, and what it's final state was.

In this case, we only care about coin store changes.

<details>
<summary>Coin Store Changes</summary>
```json
  "changes": [
  {
    "address": "0x559d4f690c683fca7c539237aa8dc4c6ec09886b7016bf66f2cdeffef55468f0",

              "addr": "0x559d4f690c683fca7c539237aa8dc4c6ec09886b7016bf66f2cdeffef55468f0",
              "creation_num": "3"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "type": "write_resource"
  },
  {
    "address": "0x5d6233bb8d7f8bd714af196339e9fb3104c9d66f38867b2a0585c4f7b9d04d28",

        },

              "creation_num": "2"
            }
          }
        },
        "frozen": false,
        "withdraw_events": {
          "counter": "0",
          "guid": {
            "id": {
              "addr": "0x5d6233bb8d7f8bd714af196339e9fb3104c9d66f38867b2a0585c4f7b9d04d28",
              "creation_num": "3"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "type": "write_resource"
  }],
```
</details>

3. Events are the events that were emitted by the transaction.  In this case, we
only care about the `0x1::coin::deposit` and `0x1::coin::withdraw` events.

The Coin deposit event is emitted when coins are deposited into an account. The
account's balance will increase by that amount in the field `data.amoount`.  To
determine the matching asset, you must match the `guid` in the `deposit_events`
to the `guid` in the `changes` section for a `CoinStore`.

<details>
  <summary>Coin Deposit Event</summary>
  ```json
  {
    "events": [{
      "guid": {
        "creation_number": "2",
        "account_address": "0x5d6233bb8d7f8bd714af196339e9fb3104c9d66f38867b2a0585c4f7b9d04d28"
      },
      "sequence_number": "0",
      "type": "0x1::coin::DepositEvent",
      "data": {
        "amount": "10"
      }
    }]
  }
  ```
</details>

The Coin withdraw event is emitted when coins are withdrawn from an account. The
account's balance will decrease by that amount in the field `data.amount`.  To
determine the matching asset, you must match the `guid` in the `deposit_events`
to the `guid` in the `changes` section for a `CoinStore`.

<details>
  <summary>Coin Withdraw Event</summary>
  ```json
  {
    "events": [{
      "guid": {
        "creation_number": "3",
        "account_address": "0x559d4f690c683fca7c539237aa8dc4c6ec09886b7016bf66f2cdeffef55468f0"
      },
      "sequence_number": "52484",
      "type": "0x1::coin::WithdrawEvent",
      "data": {
        "amount": "10"
      }
    }]
  }
  ```
</details>

4. Gas usage only is tracked for APT.  There is no direct event for tracking gas,
but it can be calculated from the transaction.  Using the `gas_used` field, and
the `gas_unit_price` field, you can calculate the total gas used.  In this case,
the `gas_used` is `999` and the `gas_unit_price` is `100`, so the total gas deducted
from the sender(`0x559d4f690c683fca7c539237aa8dc4c6ec09886b7016bf66f2cdeffef55468f0`)
is `999 * 100 = 99900 subunits`  Remember that the subunits are used here. The
value in the gas token `APT` is `0.00099900 APT`.


<details>
  <summary>Gas Information</summary>
```json
 {
   "gas_used": "999",
   "max_gas_amount": "100000",
   "gas_unit_price": "100",
   "sender": "0x559d4f690c683fca7c539237aa8dc4c6ec09886b7016bf66f2cdeffef55468f0",
}
```
</details>


5. Overall, you need both the events and the changes to determine the amount transferred
of the account.  The final balances will show in the changes alone.  If you watch
all of these events, you will be able to handle all possible transactions.  Below
is the full example of the transaction response.

### Fungible Asset Balance Changes

For fungible assets, the balance changes are tracked in the `primary_fungible_store`.
The primary fungible store address is deterministic, and will always be tracked by
the owner of the store.

An example: https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/transactions/by_version/1750174030

There are a few steps when tracking fungible assets:

1. There will be two types of events for fungible assets.  `0x1::fungible_asset::Deposit` and `0x1::fungible_asset::Withdraw`.

`Withdraw` events are similar to the coin events, where the balance will decrease by the amount in the `data.amount` field.
And similarly `Deposit` events will increase the balance by the amount in the `data.amount` field.

Note that, I've omitted the sequence number, and GUID fields, as they do not apply to module events.

Each event has a `store` field, which in this case is `0x8a9d57692a9d4deb1680eaf107b83c152436e10f7bb521143fa403fa95ef76a`.
This is the address of the `FungibleStore` for the asset, where the balance is stored.  Note this, for the next step.

<details>
  <summary>Fungible Asset Events</summary>
```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "0x1::fungible_asset::Withdraw",
      "data": {
        "amount": "1",
        "store": "0x8a9d57692a9d4deb1680eaf107b83c152436e10f7bb521143fa403fa95ef76a"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "0x1::fungible_asset::Deposit",
      "data": {
        "amount": "1",
        "store": "0x8a9d57692a9d4deb1680eaf107b83c152436e10f7bb521143fa403fa95ef76a"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
</details>

2. Next, we take a look at the `0x1::fungible_asset::FungibleStore` changes.  This
will show the end state of the balance for the fungible asset.  The balance is in
the `data.balance` field.  The `address` field will match the `store` field from
the events.  The identifier of the fungible asset, is the `metadata` field.  It
is the address of the `metadata` for the fungible asset.

Additionally, to figure out the actual owner of the assets, you will need to look
at the owner of the store.  In this case, you will need the `0x1::object::ObjectCore`, where
the `address` field matches the `store` field from the events.  The `owner` field
will show the asset owner's address.

### Coins migrated to Fungible Asset Balance Changes

For coins migrated to fungible assets, it is just simply tracking of the two above.
A coin migrated to a fungible asset will have both the coin store changes and the
primary fungible asset store changes.  The amounts would need to be aggregated
together, and otherwise, handled as a coin.

The Fungible asset metadata address is the hash of the coin type and 0xA

```
address = sha3_256(0xA | coin_type | 0xFE)
```

Here is an example of a migrated coin with APT: https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/transactions/by_version/1642580695

## Transferring Assets

### Coin (or migrated coin) Transfers

<Callout type="info">
  APT, the native token of Aptos, is a migrated coin.  Please use the `aptos_account::transfer` functions
  to transfer APT tokens.
</Callout>

We suggest you use `0x1::aptos_account::transfer_coins<CoinType>(receiver address, amount)` for transferring coins.  It will
register the coin if it hasn't been registered yet, and create the associated account if it hasn't been created yet.
This will continue to work with any coins that were migrated to a fungible asset, including APT.

Coins can be transferred in the following ways:
* [`0x1::aptos_account::transfer_coins<CoinType>(receiver address, amount)`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/aptos_account.move#L108-L112) - Transfer a coin to another account.
* [`0x1::aptos_account::batch_transfer_coins<CoinType>(receiver addresses, amounts)`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/aptos_account.move#L93-L106) - Transfer a coin to multiple accounts.
* [`0x1::aptos_account::transfer(receiver address, amount)`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/aptos_account.move#L74-L91) - Transfer specifically APT to another account.

{/* TODO examples */}

### Fungible Asset Transfers

We suggest you use `0x1::primary_fungible_store::transfer<0x1::object::ObjectCore>(receiver address, amount)` for transferring fungible assets.
It will send the associated fungible asset, and create a primary store for the asset if it hasn't been created yet.

{/* TODO examples */}

<Callout type="warning">
  Note: This will not create an account for the user if it hasn't been created
  yet. You will need to call
  `0x1::aptos_account::create_account(account address)` to create the account
  before the user can
  submit transactions.
</Callout>

{ /* TODO Staking some other day */ }

## Testing

In order to check that everything is working correctly, we've provided these checks.

### Balance Checks

To test balance checks, you can check the balance for the account `0x5` for the asset `0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin`.
The balance should show `0.002 APT`, where 0.001 APT is a coin, and 0.001 APT is a migrated coin (fungible asset).

If your balance is not correct, see [Coin and Migrated Coin Balances](#coin-and-migrated-coin-balances) for more information.

### Balance Change / Transfer Checks

#### Check Coin Transfer

To test a transfer, create a transaction to transfer 0.001 APT to another account.
The transaction should be successful, and the balance should be updated, where
the balance is 0.001 APT smaller and minus the gas cost associated.

#### Check Fungible Asset Transfer

To test a transfer, you can fund an account with the fungible asset here https://test-token-faucet.vercel.app/
and then transfer the fungible asset to another account.  The balance should be updated
according to the change, and you should be able to track the mint on the website.

## FAQ

### What is the finality of a transaction?

Aptos uses a BFT consensus algorithm, so transactions are finalized immediately
after committing to the blockchain.

### What is the transaction fee on a transaction?

Transaction fees are variable, but for most cases here are fixed.  Check out
[simulating transactions](../../network/blockchain/gas-txn-fee#estimating-gas-consumption-via-simulation)
to get an idea of the fee.
