# Build an End-to-End Dapp on Aptos

A common way to learn a new framework or programming language is to build a simple todo list. In this tutorial, we will learn how to build an end-to-end todo list dapp, starting from the smart contract side through the front-end side and finally use of a wallet to interact with the two.

See the completed code in the [my_first_dapp](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/main/aptos-move/move-examples/my_first_dapp).

## Chapters

After meeting the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and [getting set up](#setup) as described below, you will follow this tutorial in this order:

1. [Create a smart contract](build-e2e-dapp/1-create-smart-contract.mdx)
2. [Set up React app](build-e2e-dapp/2-set-up-react-app.mdx)
3. [Add Wallet support](build-e2e-dapp/3-add-wallet-support.mdx)
4. [Fetch Data from Chain](build-e2e-dapp/4-fetch-data-from-chain.mdx)
5. [Submit data to chain](build-e2e-dapp/5-submit-data-to-chain.mdx)
6. [Handle Tasks](build-e2e-dapp/6-handle-tasks.mdx)

## Prerequisites

You must have:

- [Aptos CLI](../cli.mdx)
- [Aptos TypeScript SDK](../sdks/ts-sdk.mdx)
- [Aptos Wallet Adapter](../sdks/wallet-adapter.mdx)
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Although we will explain some React decisions, we are not going to deep dive into how React works; so we assume you have some previous experience with React.

## Setup

In this section, we will create a `my-first-dapp` directory to hold our project files, both client-side code (React based)and the Move code (our smart contract).

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the desired directory for the project (for example, the `Desktop` directory).
2. Create a new directory called `my-first-dapp`, for example:

```bash filename="Terminal"
mkdir my-first-dapp
```

3. Navigate into that directory:

```bash filename="Terminal"
cd my-first-dapp
```

Now let's [create a smart contract](build-e2e-dapp/1-create-smart-contract.mdx).
