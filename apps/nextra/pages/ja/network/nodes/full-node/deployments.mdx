# Deploy a PFN

The following guides provide step-by-step instructions for deploying a PFN on the Aptos networks.

<Callout type="info">
**Do I have to run a PFN?**<br />
If you do not wish to run a PFN, but still want to interact with the Aptos blockchain, you can use the REST API
provided by the Aptos Labs' PFNs (see [Aptos APIs](../../../build/apis.mdx)). Note, however, that Aptos Labs-provided PFNs have rate
limits, which can impede your development. If you want to avoid such rate limits, you can deploy your own PFN
and synchronize with the Aptos blockchain directly.

Select the guide for the deployment method you prefer:

<Callout type="warning">
**Choose a network**<br />
These guides default to deploying a PFN in the Aptos mainnet network, but they can easily be used to do
the same in other networks (e.g., devnet or testnet network). To do so, check out the desired network branch
and use the `genesis.blob` and `waypoint.txt` node files for the respective branches:
[mainnet](../configure/node-files-all-networks/node-files-mainnet.mdx),
[devnet](../configure/node-files-all-networks/node-files-devnet.mdx), and
[testnet](../configure/node-files-all-networks/node-files-testnet.mdx).
