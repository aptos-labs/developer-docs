# Develop with Localnet

## Recommended

Most developers should use the CLI to run a local development network.
It is simpler and more fully featured than just a single node localnet + faucet.
If you want a local stack that works just like a production network
([Node API](../../build/apis.mdx) + [Transaction Stream](../../build/indexer/txn-stream.mdx) +
[Indexer API](../../build/indexer.mdx) + Faucet), this is the option for you.
