# Run a Public Fullnode

You can run your own public fullnode (PFN) to synchronize the state of the Aptos blockchain and stay
up-to-date. PFNs replicate the entire state of the blockchain by syncing from other Aptos VFNs and PFNs. PFNs
can be run by anyone. This section explains how to deploy a PFN and connect to an Aptos network. You can learn
more about the different types of nodes in the [Blockchain Deep Dive](../blockchain.mdx) section.

<Callout type="info">
**Default connection to mainnet**<br />
If you follow the default setup in this document, then your PFN will be connected to the Aptos mainnet. To connect
to a different Aptos network, such as devnet or testnet, make sure you have the correct docker image tag, or source
code branch if you build the binary directly.

You can find the genesis and waypoint files for all the networks, here ➜ https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-networks.
