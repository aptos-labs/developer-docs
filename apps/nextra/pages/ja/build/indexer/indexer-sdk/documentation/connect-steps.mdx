# Connecting Steps

## Pre-requisite
At this point, you'd have already followed the [Creating a Processor](./create-processor.mdx) and [Creating a Step](./steps.mdx) guides.
Our next goal is to put those two pieces together and connect steps within the processor.

## How to connect steps 

Now that you have created a step, you can connect it to other steps.
To do so, we use a builder class called `ProcessorBuilder` to specify a sequence of steps that make up a processor.

1. After you've instantiated your steps, you need to convert them into [`RunnableStep`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processors-sdk/sdk/src/traits/runnable_step.rs#L6).
`RunnableStep` is a trait that wraps around a step.
It provides the necessary input and output channels that feed into the step and allows the step to be spawned in a task.
The SDK provides a helper function [`.into_runnable_step`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processors-sdk/sdk/src/traits/into_runnable_step.rs#L13) to convert a step into a `RunnableStep`.
2. Setup your first step with [`ProcessorBuilder::new_with_inputless_first_step`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processors-sdk/sdk/src/builder/processor_builder.rs#L222). 
In almost all cases, the first step should be a `TransactionStreamStep`. {/* <!-- Add link --> */} 
3. Connect the previous step to the next step using [`.connect_to`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processors-sdk/sdk/src/builder/processor_builder.rs#L303). 
 `connect_to` uses trait bounds to ensure at compile time that the output type of the previous step matches the input type of the next step.
 When calling `.connect_to`, a channel gets created with size `channel_size` and connects the previous and next steps. 
 It also spawns a task that continuously loops the previous step -- reading data from its input channel, processing the data, and sending the output to its output channel.
4. Repeat step 3 for each step in your processor.
5. To close off the `ProcessorBuilder`, use [`.end_and_return_output_receiver`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processors-sdk/sdk/src/builder/processor_builder.rs#L400). 
This returns an [`InstrumentedAsyncReceiver`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-sdk/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processors-sdk/instrumented-channel/src/lib.rs#L88) which you can use to process the output of the last step in the graph. 

Here's a simple example of connecting two steps:
```rust
let (processor_builder, buffer_receiver) = ProcessorBuilder::new_with_inputless_first_step(
      transaction_stream_step.into_runnable_step(),
  )
  .connect_to(extractor_step.into_runnable_step(), 10)
  .end_and_return_output_receiver(10);
```

Here's a [full example](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processor-example/blob/main/aptos-indexer-processor-example/src/processors/events/events_processor.rs#L75) from `aptos-indexer-processor-example`.

## Visualizing the processor
As you connect steps, `ProcessorBuilder` in the background is constructing a graphical representation of the steps in your processor using [`petgraph`](https://docs.rs/petgraph/latest/petgraph/).
You can see the visual representation of the graph by calling
```rust
let dot = processor_builder.graph.dot();
println!("{}", dot);
```
This will output a graph in the [DOT language](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/doc/info/lang.html) that you can visualize using tools like [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/).
