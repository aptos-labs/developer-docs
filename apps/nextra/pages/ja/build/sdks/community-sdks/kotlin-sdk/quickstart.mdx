# Kotlin SDK Quickstart

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Kaptos,
fetching data, and sending a transaction on the Aptos blockchain.

<Steps>
### Install the SDK

Kaptos is available for both multiplatform and single-platform development.
Artifacts are published at Sonatype Maven Central and can be added to your
project using Gradle as shown below:

#### Multiplatform Development
In your `build.gradle.kts` file, and in your `commonMain` source set block, add as follows:
```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain.dependencies {
            implementation("xyz.mcxross.kaptos:kaptos:<version>")
        }
    }
}
```

#### Single-platform Development

Depending on your target platform, Kaptos provides different artifacts in the
form of `kaptos-jvm`, `kaptos-android`, `kaptos-iosArm64`, and `kaptos-js`.
For example, to add the JVM artifact to your project, add the following dependency:
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("xyz.mcxross.kaptos:kaptos-jvm:<version>")
}
```

To add the Android artifact, use:
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("xyz.mcxross.kaptos:kaptos-android:<version>")
}
```


### Set up the `Aptos` client

You can use the `Aptos` object to handle everything that requires a connection
to the Aptos network.

```kotlin
val aptos = Aptos()
```
If you want to pass in a custom configuration, you can do so by passing in a
AptosConfig object that takes in an AptosSettings object. The AptosSettings object
allows you to specify the network you want to connect to, the fullnode URL, and
other settings.

```kotlin
val settings = AptosSettings(network = Network.MAINNET, clientConfig = ClientConfig(maxRetries = 10))
val aptosConfig = AptosConfig(settings = settings)
val aptos = Aptos(aptosConfig)
```

    Kaptos offers common configurations for all platforms while also providing
    platform-specific settings. For instance, you can configure both connection
    and request timeouts on Linux, whereas on iOS, you can only set request timeouts.
</Callout>

### Fetch data from on-chain
  Once you have an `Aptos` object, you can use it to fetch data from the Aptos blockchain.
  For example, you can fetch the ledger information like so:

  ```kotlin
  val ledgerInfo = aptos.getLedgerInfo()
  ```
### Send Transactions
  To interact with the ledger and change its state, you must send transactions.
  To do this, you need an existing account. You can create an account by
  generating a new account key pair and funding the account on-chain.
  Once you have an account, you can sign transactions to demonstrate authority,
  allowing you to perform actions such as transferring tokens, triggering Move
  modules, or trading NFTs.

  Here's how you can build a transaction to transfer APT:

  <Steps>

    ### Create an Account

    To create a new account, you first generate new credentials then fund the account.
    On devnet networks, you can fund an account programmatically by asking a "faucet"

    ```kotlin
    val aliceAccount = Account.generate()
    val bobAccount = Account.generate()
    ```

    On testnet you can mint at the [mint page](/network/faucet).

    ### Build the Transaction

  ```kotlin
  val txn = aptos.buildTransaction.simple(
      sender = aliceAccount.accountAddress,
      data = entryFunctionData {
          function = "0x1::coin::transfer"
          typeArguments = typeArguments {
              +TypeTagStruct("0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin")
          }
          functionArguments = functionArguments {
              +bobAccount.accountAddress
              +U64(SEND_AMOUNT)
          }
  },)
  ```

  ### Sign the Transaction
    Once you have built a transaction, you can sign it using the `sign` method.

    ```kotlin
      val aliceAuthenticator = aptos.sign(
          sender = aliceAccount,
          transaction = txn,
      )
    ```

  ### Submit the Transaction
    Finally, you can submit the transaction to the network using the `submitTransaction.simple` method.

    ```kotlin
    val commitedTransaction = aptos.submitTransaction.simple(
          transaction = signedTransaction,
          senderAuthenticator = aliceAuthenticator,
    )
    ```

  ### Wait for the Transaction to Execute
    Then you can wait for the transaction to be executed by using the `waitForTransaction` method.

    ```kotlin
    val executedTransaction = aptos.waitForTransaction(HexInput.fromString(commitedTransaction.expect("Transaction failed").hash))
    ```
  </Steps>
