# Creating and Managing Accounts

**Kaptos** provides a few ways to generate account credentials, both _legacy_ and
`SingleKeyAccount`s. You can either generate a new account or derive
an account from a private key.

## Legacy Account

**Kaptos** offers a straightforward method to generate a legacy account using the
`Account` class. By invoking the static method `generate()`, you can create a new
legacy account either by passing no arguments or by explicitly setting
the `scheme` to `SigningSchemeInput.Ed25519` and the `legacy` property to `true` as
shown below.
### Generate a New Account

To create a new legacy account, you can generate a new account credential using the
`Account.generate()` method. This method will create a new account with a new
key pair.

```kotlin
val account = Account.generate()
```

You can also use the `Ed25519Account` class that provides a **nullary** method,
`generate()`, to create a new account:

```kotlin
val account = Ed25519Account.generate()
```

### Derive an Account from a Private Key

If you have a private key, you can use it to create an `Account` object to manage
those credentials.

```kotlin
val privateKey = Ed25519PrivateKey("myEd25519privatekeystring")

val account = Account.fromPrivateKey(privateKey)
```

## Single Key Account

The SDK offers two ways to generate a single key account: using either the
`SingleKeyAccount` or the `Account` class. In both cases, you can create a
new account by calling the static `generate()` method. Youâ€™ll need to specify
the `scheme`, and for the `Account` class, you can optionally set the `legacy`
property to `false`.

```kotlin
val secp256k1SKAccount = SingleKeyAccount.generate(SigningSchemeInput.Secp256k1)
val ed25519SKAccount = SingleKeyAccount.generate(SigningSchemeInput.Ed25519)
```

Using the `Account` class, you can create a new single key account by setting
the `scheme` to `SigningSchemeInput.Secp256k1` and optionally setting the
`legacy` property to `false`. Alternatively, you can set the `scheme` to
`SigningSchemeInput.Ed25519` and ensure the `legacy` property is also
set to `false`.

```kotlin
val secp256k1SKAccount = Account.generate(scheme = SigningSchemeInput.Secp256k1)
val ed25519SKAccount = Account.generate(scheme = SigningSchemeInput.Ed25519, legacy = false)
```

## On-chain Account Creation

It is also worth noting that Account generation does not create the account
on-chain. You must fund the account on-chain to use it for transactions.
On test networks, you can fund an account programmatically by asking a
"faucet" for test tokens. You can do this as shown below:

```kotlin
val fundedAccount = aptos.fundAccount(aliceAccount.accountAddress, FUNDING_AMOUNT)
```

This only works on devnet. On testnet you can mint at the [mint page](/network/faucet).
