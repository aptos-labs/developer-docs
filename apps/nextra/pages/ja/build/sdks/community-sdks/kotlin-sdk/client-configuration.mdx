# Client Configuration

Whilst **Kaptos** offers a **consistent interface** for interacting with Aptos
across all supported platforms, it also features both shared and
platform-specific configuration options for its various clients.

These configuration options allow you to customize the behavior of the client to
suit your needs. They can be set by creating a `ClientConfig` object and passing
it to the `AptosSettings` object when creating an `Aptos` client as shown below:

```kotlin
val clientConfig = ClientConfig(followRedirects = false, retryOnServerErrors = 3)
val client = Aptos(AptosConfig(AptosSettings(clientConfig = clientConfig)))
```

This page will guide you through the available configuration options for
each platform.

### Shared Configuration

`followRedirects` — A boolean value that determines whether the client should
follow redirects. The default value is `true`.

`retryOnServerErrors` — The number of times to retry the request if a server error
occurs. The default value is `—1`, which means no retries.

`requestTimeout` — The timeout in milliseconds for the request. The default value
is `10_000`.

`maxRetries` — The maximum number of times to retry the request. The default value
is `-1`, which means no retries.

`agent` — A `String` that specifies the user agent to use for the connection.
Defaults to `Kaptos/{PLATFORM}`.

`likeAgent` — A `UserAgent` enum value that specifies the user agent to use for the
connection.

`proxy` — A `String` that specifies the proxy server to use for the connection.

`cache` — A boolean value that determines whether to cache the response. The default
value is `false`.

### JVM Configuration

`pipelining` — A boolean value that determines whether the client should use
pipelining. The default value is `false`.

`pipelineMaxSize` — The maximum number of requests to pipeline. The default value
is `20`.

`maxConnectionsPerRoute` — The maximum number of connections per route. The default
value is `100`.

`maxConnectionsCount` — The maximum number of connections. The default value is
`100`.

`connectTimeoutMillis` — The timeout in milliseconds for establishing a connection
to the server. The default value is `10_000`.

`keepAliveTime` — The time in milliseconds to keep a connection alive. The default
value is `5_000`.

`connectAttempts` — The number of times to attempt to connect to the server. The
default value is `5`.

`connectTimeout` — The timeout in milliseconds for establishing a connection to the
server. The default value is `10_000`.

### Android Configuration

`followSslRedirects` — A boolean value that determines whether the client should
follow SSL redirects. The default value is `true`.

`connectTimeoutMillis` — The timeout in milliseconds for establishing a connection
to the server. The default value is `10_000`.

`readTimeoutMillis` — The timeout in milliseconds for reading data from the server.
The default value is `10_000`.

`writeTimeoutMillis` — The timeout in milliseconds for writing data to the server.
The default value is `10_000`.

`maxRetries` — The maximum number of times to retry the request. The default value
is `-1`, which means no retries.

`connectTimeout` — The timeout in milliseconds for establishing a connection to the
server. The default value is `10_000`.

### Apple (iOS, macOS) Configuration

Apple platforms currently do not have any platform-specific configuration options.

### Web Configuration

Web platforms currently do not have any platform-specific configuration options.

### Linux Configuration

`connectTimeout` — The timeout in milliseconds for establishing a connection to the
server. The default value is `10_000`.

### Windows Configuration

`connectTimeout` — The timeout in milliseconds for establishing a connection to the
server. The default value is `10_000`.
