# Keyless Accounts

The Aptos .NET SDK provides an implementation of Keyless accounts to derive accounts from social provider logins. In this guide,
we will provide snippets of creating accounts.

## Creating KeylessAccounts

KeylessAccounts are created to sign transactions and interact with the blockchain using social provider logins. To create a Keyless account,
you will need to follow a few steps to obtain the necessary components of a Keyless account.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  We plan on creating end-to-end guides on integrating Keyless with Unity and
  Godot. They are currently in development.

<Steps>

### Create a Ephemeral Key Pair

The first step to creating a Keyless account is to create an ephemeral key pair. This is an ephemeral key used to sign transactions. It's important
to store this key pair in a secure location in the application as it will be used to sign transactions.

```csharp
var ephemeralKeyPair = EphemeralKeyPair.Generate();
```

### Obtaining an OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Token

To obtain an `id_token` (OIDC Identity Token), you will need to authenticate with a social provider. At the end of the authorization flow, the user should be redirected
to your application with an `id_token`. You will need to store this `id_token` in a secure location in the application. **It's important that the `id_token` has a nonce field that matches the `nonce` field inside the `EphemeralKeyPair`.**

**Example:**

```csharp
var nonce = ephemeralKeyPair.Nonce;
var authorizationUrl = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth&nonce=" + nonce;
```

### Deriving a Keyless Account

Once the user has the following components, they should be able to derive a Keyless account.

- `id_token`: Obtained from the authorization flow.
- `EphemeralKeyPair`: Created in the previous steps.

**It's important that the `nonce` field inside the `EphemeralKeyPair` matches the `nonce` field inside the `id_token` to ensure that the user can sign transactions.**

```csharp
var client = new AptosClient(Networks.Mainnet);
var keylessAccount = await client.Keyless.DeriveAccount(idToken, ephemeralKeyPair);
```

### Sign and Submit transactions

After deriving a Keyless account, you can sign and submit transactions using the `AptosClient`.

```csharp
// 1. Build the transaction
var transaction = await client.Transaction.Build(
    sender: keylessAccount,
    data: new GenerateEntryFunctionPayloadData(
        function: "0x1::aptos_account::transfer_coins",
        typeArguments: ["0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin"],
        functionArguments: [account.Address, "100000"]
    )
);

// 2. Sign and submit the transaction
var submittedTransaction = await client.Transaction.SignAndSubmitTransaction(keylessAccount, transaction);

// 3. (Optional) Wait for the transaction to be committed
var committedTransaction = await client.Transaction.WaitForTransaction(submittedTransaction.Hash);
```

</Steps>
