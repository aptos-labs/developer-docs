<Steps>

### Sign in to Vercel

Navigate to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with your Github account (not necessarily your Aptos Labs email).

> Note: Reach out to a Vercel Admin (PE) to be added to Vercel if you don't have access.

### Add New Project

Once you're authenticated, there will be a button in the top right hand corner to "Add New Project"

### Import Git Repository

In Import Git Repository, search for the repository you're looking for. If it is not found, click on the `Configure Github App` button.

> Note: You may need to request for help from an Aptos Labs Github Admin (PE) to enable your repo to be imported into Vercel
